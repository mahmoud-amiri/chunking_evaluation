Although numerous transition metal oxides have been explored as OER catalysts, the scaling relationship of the binding energies of various surface-bound intermediates imposes a limit on the maximum activity of these oxides. While previous computational studies have suggested bifunctional catalysts might be capable of overcoming this limit, stable and non-precious catalysts of this type remain elusive",
