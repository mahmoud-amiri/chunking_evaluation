Since 3DDPDs could not be applied to predict mutant bioactivity due to the lack of available data for our set, the power of the dynamic descriptors to discriminate between variants was investigated by clustering them based on the distance between descriptor vectors. To this end, rs3DDPDs were able to cluster all variants of the same target together, and smaller clusters were formed for mutants with similar dynamic behaviors compared to wild type (Figure 7a, Figure S6)",
