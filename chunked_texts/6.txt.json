The nature of the remaining side reactions was hinted at by the difference in cyclic performance between static and dynamic argon atmosphere, indicating outgassing and/or gas evolution. This will certainly be investigated in future research.\n\n5 Conflicts of Interest\n\nThere are no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n6 Acknowledgements",
