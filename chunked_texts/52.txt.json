Desiccators are essential laboratory tools for drying solids and maintaining low humidity to prevent unwanted reactions. The choice of desiccant is critical, as they reach different residual humidity and perform the drying process with different speed. Additionally, the desiccant can react and therefore remove not only water from the gas phase inside the desiccator",
