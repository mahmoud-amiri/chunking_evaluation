In U.S. higher education, course letter grades are determined frequently by the number of overall points a student accumulates throughout a term culminating with a final letter grade assigned on an A-F scale.

Furthermore, when we assign points and partial credit to student work and sum the points, there is often no direct connection between the grade students earn and what course learning outcomes (LOs) they have achieved [2,3]. Grades become a ranking of students against each other rather than an indication of achievement of the LOs by each individual student [3]. This ranking issue is exacerbated in courses that employ curves to determine how many points correspond to a letter grade [4,5].",
