This paper explores the complexities of the thermal degradation of vegetable oil, highlighting the interdependent interactions among its various factors. The heterogeneity in oil composition and external factors such as temperature, frying time, and frying cycles, adds to the difficulty in understanding the degradation process. Research efforts have focused on internal factors like fatty acid composition and antioxidants and external factors such as heating temperature and time",
