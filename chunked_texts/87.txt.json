By leveraging the Amber platform, we anticipate that ML/MM can be extended beyond its current capabilities, and be easily combined with other advanced simulation technologies. We envision our future work will focus on integrating more MLIPs, further expanding the method\u2019s functionality, and enabling ML/MM to handle increasingly complex scenarios.\n\n5 Supporting Information",
