ABSTRACT: Transition-metal-catalyzed cleavage of the Si–H bond in silanes to yield silyl radicals requires substantial amounts of energy, which is commonly supplied by photons. For Rh(II) porphyrins, efficient hydrosilylation catalysis only becomes accessible upon site isolation in a MOF, and the formation of free silyl radicals likewise requires irradiation. Within the MOF, however, an uncommonly facile direct silyl radical transfer to olefin substrates is also possible, which makes thermal olefin hydrosilylation accessible at room temperature. The ability of MOF-supported Rh(II) metalloradicals to furnish an unprecedented 3-center-3-electron (3c-3e) Rh(II)-silane σ-adduct enables the assembly of a tri-component transition state that is comprised of Rh(II), silylene and ethylene. The tri-component transition state bypasses the high-energy silyl radical species and enables silyl radical transfer with an activation free energy ~15 kcal mol⁻¹ below the minimum energy barrier for silyl radical formation. We report direct observation of the 3c-3e silane σ-adduct, which is a stable species in the absence of light and olefins. Furthermore, a combination of experiments and quantum mechanical calculations show that direct silyl radical transfer to ethylene is promoted by the temporary oxidation of the transition structure by a proximal Rh(II) center. Thus, the crucial role of the MOF matrix is to fix the inter-Rh separation in our catalyst at a value large enough for 3c-3e silane adduct formation, but short enough for facile electron transfer.

INTRODUCTION

Photons are a necessary component of a rapidly increasing number of synthetic transformations.¹ In the majority of cases, illumination is used to generate high-energy open shell intermediates, which can engage in subsequent reaction steps with small kinetic barriers. The development of photocatalysts that permit the use of visible rather than UV light to cleave strong bonds vastly increased the scope and practical utility of photochemical reactions.² Even visible light photons are highly energetic, however, with 450 nm photons carrying an energy of 63.6 kcal mol⁻¹. Since many synthetic reactions have low quantum yields, the high reactivity of radical intermediates comes at a substantial energy cost. Ideally, we could harness the versatile reactivity of high-energy radicals without ever having to generate them as free species. An energy-efficient direct transfer of an incipient radical to a radical acceptor could unlock more energy efficient and sustainable radical reactions. For a reaction involving a catalyst, a radical generator and a radical acceptor species, a direct transfer reaction would be possible if all three species could be assembled together. But except under extreme conditions, such as those present during the formation of a star, triatomic collisions rarely take place.³ An additional challenge is that the catalyst and both reagents are not atoms, but molecules of reasonable complexity. For multi-atomic molecules, not only the minute collision frequency but also the need for correct alignment of all species renders it unlikely for termolecular steps to contribute noticeably to reaction rates (Figure 1A). Terrestrial chemical transformations thus generally proceed via successive uni- and bi-molecular reaction steps.⁴,⁵ In the case of catalytic radical hydrosilylation reaction, an initial encounter between catalyst and silane leads to the formation of a free silyl radical, which then reacts with an olefin in a separate reaction step (Figure 1B). For Rh(II) porphyrin catalysis, the difference in Gibbs free energy between the reagents (silane and Rh(II)) and the products (Rh(III)-H and silyl radical) is calculated to be 25.5 kcal mol⁻¹ (Figure S69). However, for hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) to take place, two molecules need to associate into a transition structure which results in energy penalty due to the loss of translational and rotational degrees of freedom that corresponds to approximately 10 kcal mol⁻¹.⁶,⁷ A catalyst that is able to assemble a silane and an olefin into a transition state for direct radical transfer with an energy input of less than 25.5 + 10 = 35.5 kcal mol⁻¹ would thus permit a more energy-efficient transformation. Such a transition state would need to be assembled in a step-wise fashion to limit the entropic penalty. We define here the term “tri-component” as a transition state that brings together three individual species but is not assembled via a termolecular collision, and thus entropically accessible (Figure 1C). To render the formation of a tri-component transition state feasible,
the Rh(II) catalyst and the silane need to be able to form an adduct with sufficient stability that it survives under the reaction conditions for an appreciable amount of time.

Existing examples in which the assembly of silanes and substrates by a transition metal center leads to transformations with a low activation barrier can be found for the formal transfer of silyl cations (Figure 2A). A mechanism put forth originally by Crabtree, and extensively refined by Brookhart and Oestreich invokes a 3-center-2-electron (3c-2e) interaction between a silane and an empty transition metal orbital as a crucial reaction intermediate.\(^9\)\(^-\)\(^12\) Binding of the silane to the metal center enables a low energy barrier transfer of a silyl equivalent to polar substrates such as ketones,\(^12\)\(^,\)\(^13\) alcohols,\(^14\) CO\(_2\),\(^15\)\(^,\)\(^16\) and even weakly nucleophilic alkyl halides and dialkylethers.\(^17\)\(^-\)\(^19\) Inspired by the role of the 3c-2e interaction in providing a low energy pathway for the formal transfer of silyl, we aimed to access a corresponding 3c-3e silane σ-adduct to facilitate silyl radical transfer (Figure 2B). While many metal complexes featuring 3c-2e silane adducts have been studied and structurally characterized,\(^14\)\(^,\)\(^20\)\(^-\)\(^25\) to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of a 3c-3e silane adduct. A substantial challenge in the stabilization of 3c-3e interactions is that one of the two species participating in the interaction is a radical, which can undergo further reaction with the 3c-3e adduct to generate two strong 2c-2e bonds (Figure 2C,D). Kinetic barriers for the reactions of radicals tend to be low, so that the low prevalence of 3c-3e interactions is readily accounted for by a decomposition pathway that is thermodynamically favorable, and, in the absence of steric or geometric restrictions, extremely facile. Ribas and coworkers reported a rare example of a 3c-3e adduct between a macrocycle-supported Cu(II) and a C-H bond on the ligand, which decomposes readily via a bimolecular pathway.\(^25\)

In this work, we set out to elucidate the origin of the reactivity differences that emerge when Rh(II) porphyrin centers are placed in a MOF environment. Prior to in-depth mechanistic studies, we excluded that hydrosilylation proceeded via a radical chain reaction initiated by Rh(II) based on the following evidence:

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We have previously shown that Rh(II) centers site-isolated in the porphyrin-containing MOFs PCN-224 (Rh(II)-3) or PCN-222 (Rh(II)-4) are efficient hydrosilylation catalysts.\textsuperscript{27}
(i) prior literature reports state that triallylsilanes are unsuitable substrates for hydroisilylation via a radical chain mechanism,28 (ii) no reaction was observed when we replaced 3 with AIBN (Figure S1–S3), and (iii) an on-off experiment showed substantial differences in the reaction rate in the presence and absence of light (Figure S4). The active Rh(II) catalyst is generated by photolysis of a Rh(III)-Me pre-catalyst during which methyl radicals are generated. We could exclude that methyl radicals contribute noticeably to the observed reactivity since no decrease in reaction rates was observed when re-used catalyst (from which no methyl radicals can be released) was used to catalyze olefin hydroisilylation (Figure S5–S6). Based on detailed EPR analyses, labeling and trapping experiments, kinetic data, as well as solution and solid-state NMR experiments, which we will discuss below, we propose the catalytic cycles depicted in Figure 3, which are corroborated by quantum-chemical calculations. Our proposal includes two different reaction pathways for the rate-limiting transfer of silyl radical from the silane to the olefin, of which one leads to the generation of free silyl radicals, while the second pathway achieves a direct silyl radical transfer to the olefin.

Characterization of the active catalyst

While we have previously shown that photolysis of Rh(Me)-3 gave rise to reactivity that was consistent with the formation of site-isolated Rh(II), no direct evidence for the formation of Rh(II) was provided. Here we present direct characterization of Rh(II)-3 and Rh(II)-4 via continuous-wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy (Figure 6A). The shape of the EPR signal arises from the coupling of the electronic spin \( S = 1/2 \) of Rh(II) with the nuclear spin of \( ^{103}\text{Rh} I = 1/2 \) with \( g_r > g_e > \beta \) typical of a \( d^7 \) singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO). Computer simulations of the spectrum shows the contribution of a major species with spin Hamiltonian parameters consistent with the reported data for homogeneous porphyrin Rh(II) metalloradicals in a frozen solvent matrix (Figure S23 and S32). We also derived the average distance between Rh(II) centers in Rh(II)-3 and Rh(II)-4 from line shape analysis of the EPR spectra. By assuming that the broadening of EPR signals results from the interaction between adjacent Rh(II) centers and applying a simple dipolar coupling model (Figure S32 and Table S12), we obtained Rh(II)-Rh(II) intermolecular separation values of 1.81 nm in the case of Rh(II)-3 and 1.24 nm for Rh(II)-4. Both values are in good agreement with the separation between porphyrin centers in the X-ray structures of PCN-224 (1.9 nm) and PCN-222 (1.06 nm for triangular pores). A larger discrepancy is expected for PCN-222 due to the presence of hexagonal as well as triangular pores, so that the dipolar coupling observed by EPR is averaged over two sets of Rh(II) centers located at different distances. The agreement between EPR-derived Rh(II)-Rh(II) separations and the crystallographically determined porphyrin spacing is consistent with a complete conversion of Rh(III)Me to Rh(II) sites upon irradiation. Complete conversion of Rh(III)-Me to Rh(II) was further confirmed by \(^1H\)-NMR analysis of the metalloporphyrin linker that was recovered when Rh(II)-3 or Rh(II)-4 were subjected to digestion under basic conditions.28 We also observed the presence of methane and toluene after Rh(Me)-3 was irradiated in benzene, which is consistent with the release of methyl radicals that undergo reaction with the benzene solvent, as previously described by Wayland and co-workers.26 Notably, EDX analysis of 3 recovered from catalytic reactions remained consistent with the complete metatation of all porphyrin sites by rhodium.28

To confirm that the metalloradical species, Rh(II)-3, observed by EPR spectroscopy constitutes a kinetically competent catalyst for olefin hydroisilylation, we monitored the rate of ethylene hydroisilylation (Figure 4). Direct use of Rh(Me)-3 in light-promoted hydroisilylation showed an initiation period of close to 5 h, which we attribute to the conversion of the bench-stable Rh(III)-Me precursor to catalytically active Rh(II)-3 (Figure 4A). Since site-isolation renders the Rh(II) catalyst stable to storage under inert conditions, direct use of Rh(II)-3 in catalysis could also be tested (Figure 4B). As expected, the initiation period disappeared for Rh(II)-3, and the effective rate constant is identical within experimental error to that observed with Rh(Me)-3.
after 5 h of reaction (Figure 4A). Rh(II)-3 is thus gradually formed under the light-mediated reaction conditions and is a kinetically competent catalyst for olefin hydrosilylation.

**Oxygen Effect on Thermal Hydrosilylation**

In order to compare the kinetic profile of light-mediated and thermal hydrosilylation with Rh(II)-3, we attempted numerous in-situ NMR experiments. Unfortunately, duplicate measurements frequently gave rise to notably different conversion rates (Figure S8–S10). During our search for the source of the rate variation, we employed increasingly rigorous means of excluding oxygen during the synthesis of active catalyst Rh(II)-3. When the reaction was set up in an argon-filled glove box with freeze-pump-thaw deoxygenated benzene we obtained Rh(II)-3 that gave rise to only 4% conversion in hydrosilylation. Metalloradical Rh(II)-3 is itself an effective oxygen trap, so we recycled the benzene for subsequent syntheses of the active catalyst. Rh(II)-3 from the first recycle achieved 2% conversion and Rh(II)-3 from the second recycle gave only 0.3% conversion, compared to ~20% conversion for Rh(II)-3 prepared with benzene that was only sparged with argon. To test whether the addition of small amounts of oxygen during the preparation of Rh(II)-3 increased the catalyst’s hydrosilylation performance, we introduced controlled amounts of air (Figure 5A,B). Two plateaus were observed that corresponded to the addition of ~1 equivalent of O2 and more than 10 equivalents of O2 per Rh(II) center, respectively. While addition of 10 – 33 equivalents of O2 furnished Rh(II)-3 that was able to achieve close to 50% conversion, Rh(II)-3 that was prepared in air was substantially less active (Figure 5B). We confirmed that oxygen rather than any other components of non-dried air was responsible for the rate enhancement by repeating key experiments with dried O2 gas (Figure S17).

**Figure 5.** A Evaluation of the effect of oxygen during active catalyst preparation in benzene (B) and the effect of the solvent on the performance of Rh(II)-3 in thermal hydrosilylation (room temperature, 20 h unless stated otherwise).

In a series of control experiments (Figure S14–S15), we determined that i) while O2 must be present during active catalyst formation, the presence of O2 during the use of Rh(II)-3 in hydrosilylation is detrimental, and that ii) O2 and light must be present simultaneously. We knew from prior EPR experiments that the exposure of Rh(II) to air in the absence of light furnished Rh(III)-superoxide 9. We confirmed that superoxide formation is reversible in the presence of light, and Rh(II)-3 could be quantitatively recovered after 20 h of illumination (Figure S18). Furthermore, Rh(III)-superoxide 9 was unable to promote olefin hydrosilylation. While Rh(III)-superoxide formation was not directly responsible for the beneficial effect of O2, we speculated that 9 may be converted into Rh(III)-hydroperoxide 10 in the presence of both light and O2. A light-promoted HAT from the benzene solvent to 9 would give rise to 10 and phenyl radicals during the preparation of the active catalyst. In support of such a pathway, mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction solvent led to the detection of biphenyl-h10 when Rh(II)-3 formation was carried out in benzene and biphenyl-d10 when benzene-d6 was used as a solvent (Figure S20–S21). Fur-
thermore, FTIR analysis of Rh(II)-3 generated in the presence of 10 equivalents of O₂ furnished a band at 829 cm⁻¹ which is in good agreement with an O–O stretch of 823 cm⁻¹ for a reported rhodium-hydroperoxide (Figure S22). The band in question was absent for Rh(II)-3 generated in air-free solvent and increased in intensity when 50 equivalents of O₂ were present during Rh(II)-3 formation. We thus propose that diamagnetic Rh(III)-hydroperoxide 10 is formed alongside Rh(II)-3 when the active catalyst was prepared in the presence of a limited amount of O₂. The beneficial effect of the converting a small number of Rh(II) centers to polar Rh(III)-O-OH groups raised the possibility that ethylene hydrosilylation may occur via a polar transition state, which is explored in detail in later sections. For consistency with our earlier work, kinetic experiments and experimental activation barriers presented in the later part of this work were determined for an oxygen content that corresponds to the first plateau in Figure 5B. EPR spectroscopic characterization of reaction intermediates presented in the main text refer to rigorously deoxygenated samples in order to minimize the signal intensity of O₂. However, all spectroscopic observations were also carried out for samples with varying oxygen content to verify that all intermediates discussed below (but no additional intermediates) were likewise generated in the presence of oxygen (see SI for detailed discussion).

Characterization of the silane σ-adduct

After ensuring that Rh(II) metalloradicals, the catalytically active centers in hydrosilylation, can be quantitatively generated throughout the MOF framework, we studied the interaction between the Rh(II) center with reagents. Addition of diethylmethylsilane to a suspension of Rh(II)-3 gave rise to an immediate and drastic change in the appearance of the EPR spectrum, which was consistent with the formation of 3c-3e silane σ-adduct 6. The EPR signal of 6 is associated with substantially different g-values compared to Rh(II)-3, which can be rationalized based on the bonding interactions predicted by first principle quantum mechanical calculations of 6. The increase in the electron density at the Rh center brought about by σ-donation from the silane to the Rh center lifts the energy of the dₓ² orbital and thus increases the energy gap between the dₓ² and dₓ/z/ dᵧ/z orbitals. Since

$$g_{\perp} = g_e + \frac{6\lambda}{\Delta E_{\Sigma^2}}$$

(where λ is the spin-orbit coupling constant and \(\Delta E_{\Sigma^2-xz,xy}\) is the energy gap between the dₓ² and dₓ/z/ dᵧ/z orbitals) a lower \(g_e\) value is expected for 6 than for Rh(II)-3. Theoretical calculations located an energy minimum for an η¹ σ-adduct that features a 146° Rh–H-Si angle (Figure 6C). In theoretical calculations, a Gibbs energy of \(\Delta G_{\text{calc}} = -3.1\) kcal·mol⁻¹ was obtained for σ-adduct 6, along with predicted EPR parameters that are in good agreement with experimental observation (Figure 6B, Table S7). The Si–H bond is only slightly elongated in 6 (1.56 Å) compared to the Si–H bond in the free silane (1.51 Å), and back-donation from the Rh(II) SOMO to the Si–H σ* orbital makes only a minimal contribution to the Rh-silane interaction in 6 (Table S16). Theoretical calculations also predicted a maximum hyperfine splitting of about 48 MHz due to the H atom that bridges the Rh and Si centers. Unfortunately, the spectral features expected due to the coupling to ¹H were not fully resolved in the spectrum and generated only a broadening of the EPR signal around \(g = 1.980\).

To verify experimentally that the 3c-3e silane σ-adduct adopts an η¹ coordination mode, 6, and its deuterated variant D-6, (Figure 6D) were interrogated by hyperfine sublevel correlation spectroscopy (HYSCORE). The predicted ¹H hyperfine coupling for the H atom bridging Si and Rh atoms was outside the detection range of HYSCORE experiments at Q-band frequency. However, the gyromagnetic ratio of deuterium, which is about 7 times smaller than that of ¹H, rendered the ²H hyperfine interaction measurable. The Q-band HYSCORE spectra recorded at a magnetic field corresponding to the \(g_e\) of both 6 and D-6 exhibit a complex pattern at low frequency in both the (-,+)/(+,-) quadrants due to the interaction of the unpaired electron with ¹⁴N nuclei (I=1) from the porphyrin ring. The correlation peaks are further split into multiplets due to the quadrupole interaction. Therefore single-quantum and normally forbidden double-quantum transitions are observed in the spectra (Figure S30–S31). While the HYSCORE spectrum of 6 was characterized only by the presence of ¹⁴N signals, the spectrum of D-6 also shows cross-peaks centered at the ²H Larmor frequency (νΗ = 6.7 MHz) separated by approximately 7 MHz. Measured ²H hyperfine coupling constants are in good agreement with values calculated (Table S11) for the structural model proposed for 6 (Figure 6C). EPR spectroscopy could also furnish direct evidence for the light-mediated cleavage of silane σ-adduct 6. While 6 was still observed when a sample of it was stored at room temperature for 20 h, subjecting an identical sample to irradiation (390 nm) for 30 minutes led to the disappearance of the signal attributable to 6 (Figure 6E). Crucially, no Rh(II) signal was observed after irradiation, which is consistent with the silane σ-adduct undergoing HAT, but not with dissociation of 6 into Rh(II) and silane. Theoretical calculations support that HAT from the silane to Rh(II) in the absence of an additional interaction with ethylene is thermally inaccessible at room temperature (\(\Delta G_{\text{calc}} = 39.1\) kcal·mol⁻¹), but silyl radical release from 6 becomes thermodynamically feasible in the presence of light (the energy of a 390 nm photon corresponds to 73.3 kcal·mol⁻¹; see Figures S63 and S69 for detailed discussion). In particular, many of the bright states of 6 were predicted to have significant charge transfer character from the SOMO, which is localized on the Rh–H-Si 3c-3e bond, to the porphyrin ligand (Figure S63–S64). The SOMO has bonding character for Si–H and anti-bonding character for Rh–H, so that excitation of one electron from the SOMO weakens the Si–H bond but strengthens the Rh–H bond. Light excitation thus facilitates Si–H bond cleavage, despite the fact that the Si–H bond (BDFE = 28.7 kcal·mol⁻¹) is substantially stronger than the Rh–H bond (BDFE = 3.1 kcal·mol⁻¹) in the ground state.

Notably, however, EPR spectroscopy also provided evidence for the presence of an additional thermally accessible pathway: addition of ethylene led to the disappearance of 3c-3e silane adduct 6 within 20 h at room temperature (Figure 6E). The absence of signals attributable to Rh(II)-3 or its ethylene complex supported the proposal that ethylene addition led to hydrosilylation along with formation of diamagnetic Rh(III)–H. To understand the interactions of...
Rh(II)-3 with ethylene and silanes in more detail, we introduced ethylene to a benzene suspension of Rh(II)-3, which resulted in the formation of 3c-3e π-adduct 11. Our assignment was based on the excellent agreement of the spectral features of 11 with those reported by Wayland and coworkers for the ethylene 3c-3e π-adduct generated from sterically shielded Rh(II) porphyrin 2.38 Next, we exposed active catalyst Rh(II)-3 dispersed in benzene to both silane and ethylene in the absence of light and immediately froze the EPR sample in liquid nitrogen.

The resulting sample contained a new species associated with $g_x = 2.322(5)$, $g_y = 2.233(5)$ and $g_z = 1.984(3)$, in addition to ethylene adduct 11 and silane adduct 6. We subsequently confirmed that the new signal was detected irrespective of the order in which ethylene and silane were added to Rh(II)-3 (Figure 7A,B). Having ruled out addition complexes of oxygen, water, or benzene solvent (Table S9), we considered that the signal may originate from van der Waals adduct 12 or bis-axial adduct 13 (Figure 7C). Theoretical calculations estimated a value of 2–4 MHz for the

coupling between the unpaired spin and the ethylene protons in 13 (Table S8). However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the echo-detected signal at $g = 2.322$ position prevented experimental verification of the presence of weak coupling interactions. Theoretical calculations predicted, however, that the association of ethylene in adduct 12 is only fleeting (Figure S5B), so that spectroscopic observation of 12 was deemed unlikely. We thus tentatively attribute the signal with $g_z = 2.322$, which was only observed when both ethylene and silane were present, to the formation of 13 (Table S8). Since we had found that the addition of larger amounts of $O_2$ during the formation of Rh(II)-3 led to an increased activity of the active catalyst during hydrosilylation, we tested whether the increased catalytic activity was associated with the formation of any new radical intermediates. However, no new species were observed by EPR spectroscopy when Rh(II)-3 was generated in the presence of $~10$ instead of $~1$ equivalents of $O_2$ either for the active catalyst itself or in the presence of added reagents (Figure S28–S29).

The intensities of the signals corresponding to Rh(II)-3, 6, and 13 decreased with an increase in the amount of $O_2$ present during Rh(Me)-3 photolysis, however, due to competing formation of Rh(III)-superoxide 9. For a sample of Rh(Me)-3 that was subjected to photolysis under air, all Rh(II)-derived EPR signals were barely detectable, and only 6% conversion was achieved in thermal ethylene hydrosilylation (Figure S5B and S29). The observation of a sharp decrease in catalyst activity when Rh(II)-3 was generated in air is consistent with Rh(II) centers directly participating in the assembly of the transition state structure.

Detection of Radical Intermediates

After analysis of the interaction of reagents with the Rh(II) center we turned our attention to the detection of the proposed reaction intermediates. Since α-adduct 6 is a stable species in the absence of light and ethylene, silyl radical 8 was only an expected intermediate for the light-mediated hydrosilylation mechanism, while the formation of carbon-centered radical 7 was expected for both dark and the light-mediated reaction pathway (Figure 3). Indeed, addition of 1 equivalent of TEMPO to the light-mediated hydrosilylation reaction permitted the trapping of both suspected key intermediates, 7 and 8, as 16 and 17 (Figure 8D and S33–S34). TEMPO trapping experiments rely on the capture of fleeting radicals by a persistent radical. A persistent radical that is always present under the reaction conditions is Rh(II)-3, so we wondered if Rh(II) could be used directly as a radical trap, which would minimize the perturbation of the system. A particular concern was that TEMPO may not only be able to capture free silyl radical 8, but potentially also abstract a silyl radical equivalent from 6 (Figure S37–S40). Reliance on Rh(II) as a radical trap has the advantage that Rh(II) centers remain immobilized within the MOF framework and are unable to approach 6, while free silyl radical 8 could react with Rh(II) centers. Only a very minor portion of the organic radicals could potentially undergo radical-radical recombination with Rh(II) (an irreversible process under thermal conditions), because efficient thermal turnover of the Rh(II) catalyst was observed. To enable a sufficient amount of radical trapping products to accumulate to permit detection, we thus carried out Rh(II)-catalyzed thermal hydrosilylation for two days before the MOF was recovered and analyzed by solid-state $^{29}$Si NMR spectroscopy. A signal for 15, the product expected for the trapping of 7 by Rh(II), and to a lesser extent also 14, the trapping product of 8 by Rh(II), could be observed (Figure 8A). An approximate quantification is possible via comparison of the intensity of the signals of 15 and 14 with the signal at 7.7 ppm (marked with an asterisk in Figure 8A), which we attribute to node-bound silanol species. Silanol was formed as minor (~0.5%) by-product in all hydrosilylation reactions. The exact amount of silanol observed depends on the level of water and oxygen contamination of the hydrosilylation reaction (Figure S41–S42). The chemical shift observed for the additional peak in Figure 8A is consistent with both Zr-O-SiMe$_3$ and Et$_3$Si–O–SiMe$_3$Et$_2$, but because the species in question was not removed by washing of the MOF prior to NMR analysis, we tentatively assign the peak to silanol interacting with the MOF nodes of 3. Since a silanol-derived
signal constituted the most intense feature in the solid-state ²⁹Si NMR spectra of recovered catalysts, only a minute fraction of the silicon-centered and carbon-centered radicals were trapped by Rh(II) centers in the MOF.

Because the detection of Rh-[Si] 14 alongside Rh-CH₂-CH₂-[Si] 15 in catalyst retrieved from thermal hydrosilylation was surprising, further comparative experiments were carried to evaluate a potential contribution of silyl radicals to thermal hydrosilylation. Addition of 8 to Rh(II) could be discerned by solid-state ²⁹Si NMR analysis of recovered 3 from light-mediated hydrosilylation (14 in Figure 8A). When Rh(III)Me-3 was irradiated in the presence of only silane, Rh-[Si] 14 could again be detected (Figure 8A), which substantiates that light-mediated silyl radical release from 6 was possible even in the absence of olefin. For both experiments under light-mediated reaction conditions, a reaction time of 1 h led to the accumulation of a larger amount of Rh-[Si] 14 than was observed in thermal hydrosilylation after 2 d, even though the formation of the Rh-[Si] bond in 14 is reversible in the presence of light. Solid-state NMR data
thus indicated that the concentration of silyl radicals is substantially smaller under thermal conditions versus photochemical conditions. Trapping of carbon-centered radical 7, on the other hand, was only observed for thermal hydrosilylation. To gain further insight into the reaction condition-dependent contribution of silyl radicals, we performed double-label experiments with DSiEt₃ and HSiMe₃ (Figure S43). Analysis of residual silane after a reaction time of 23 h in the absence of light furnished a Et₅SiD : Et₅MeSiD ratio of 4.5 : 1, while a 1 : 1 ratio was observed for photochemical conditions. Since a 1:1 ratio of Et₅SiD and Et₅MeSiD was already established after a reaction time of only 0.5 h in light-mediated hydrosilylation, we could conclude that H/D exchange proceeded very efficiently in the presence of silyl radicals. The limited H/D exchange observed under thermal reaction conditions thus indicates that silyl radicals are only formed in minute amounts under thermal hydrosilylation conditions while direct formation of 7 constitutes the dominant pathway in the dark.

Irrespective of whether 7 is formed directly from 6 (thermal pathway), or whether hydrosilylation proceeds via light-promoted expulsion of 8 from 6 (photochemical pathway), however, Rh(III)-H (5) was expected to constitute a key reaction intermediate in both pathways. The ability of C-centered radicals to abstract a hydrogen atom from H–Rh(III) porphyrin complexes was shown already in 1985 by Halpern and coworkers.⁴⁶ Rh(III)-H could therefore undergo hydrogen atom abstraction by a carbon-based radical to yield the hydrosilylation product and regenerate Rh(II). We thus set out to gather evidence for the formation of Rh(III)–H under both light-mediated and dark reaction conditions. Solid-state ¹H-NMR analysis of 3 recovered for hydrosilylation reactions under light-promoted or dark conditions both furnished a signal at ~43 ppm, which indicates the presence of a hydride ligand trans to a vacant coordination site (Figure 8B).²¹ To provide an unambiguous assignment we also prepared a Rh(III)–H complex derived from the homogeneous model system 18 for the MOF catalyst, the ¹H NMR signal of which was in good agreement with that obtained from recovered 3 (Figure S44). We could furthermore show that Rh(III)–H 5 was also formed in the absence of ethylene, so that light-mediated release of silyl radical 8 from 6 is a viable reaction step in light-mediated olefin hydrosilylation. To obtain additional evidence that the proposed intermediate 5 and silyl radical 8 are formed under the reaction conditions, we performed EPR spectroscopy after addition of the spin trap N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN; Figure 8C). The formation of three different radical intermediates could be detected upon irradiation of a mixture of Rh(II)-3 and HSiMe₃:Ph. Based on the respective hyperfine coupling constants of the ¹H nucleus in the α position, we could conclude that PBN adducts of carbon-, silicon- and hydrogen-centered radicals contribute to the experimentally observed signal. A previous report of successful transfer of a hydrogen atom from Au–H to PBN substantiates our assignment that the hydrogen atom trapped by PBN originated from 5.⁵⁰ To confirm that a PBN adduct of a silyl radical contributed to the experimentally observed signal we repeated the experiment with HSiEt₃ (Figure S48), whereupon we observed noticeable changes in the EPR spectrum due to small differences in the Si hyperfine coupling with HSiMe₂Ph versus HSiEt₃.⁴⁶–⁴⁸

Molecular Dynamics Simulations

Formation of carbon-centered radical intermediate 7, either via addition of 8 to ethylene or direct silyl transfer, is expected to be irreversible: Quantum mechanical calculations show that intermediate 7 is stabilized by ΔGcalc = 15.8 kcal·mol⁻¹ relative to 8 and ethylene. We propose that 7 undergoes HAT with Rh(III)-H 5 to reform Rh(II)-3. Use of deuterated silane confirmed that the deuterium atom originally present in the silane was fully transferred to the hydrosilylation product (Figure 8E). Molecular dynamics simulations (GFN2-xTB with certain semiempirical parameters re-fitted against DFT data; see Figure S66) were able to provide additional insight into the fate of key intermediate 7. Monitoring the evolution of 7 within the MOF pore over a period of 50 ps showed that more than 72% of the carbon-centered radicals were converted into the hydrosilylation product via HAT with Rh(III)-H. Interestingly, as our model contained only one Rh(III)-H bond, the observed product is exclusively formed from 7 that did not escape its solvent cage and reacted with “its own” Rh center. Only 8% of 7 left the solvent cage and thus could potentially undergo HAT with other Rh(III)-H bonds or be trapped by Rh(II) (Fig. S67). The H and Si atoms present in the hydrosilylation product therefore predominantly originate from the same silane precursor molecule. As anticipated, ethylene expulsion from 7 to yield 8 was not observed, so that we attribute the silyl radical 8 observed experimentally as originating from bimolecular HAT. Half of the remaining 20% of 7 underwent addition to the porphyrin linker (Figure S67). Circumstantial experimental evidence that a small fraction of the radicals generated may undergo addition to the porphyrin ligand could be obtained from radical trapping experiments with PBN (Figure 8C). Specifically, trapping of a carbon centered radical was also observed for experiments in which only silane but no ethylene was present, so that the carbon-centered radical that was trapped could not be 7. Instead, a porphyrin-based radical formed upon addition of 8 to the porphyrin linker may account for the carbon centered radical trapped by PBN. Alternatively, PBN could have undergone reaction with methyl radicals generated from residual Rh(Me)-3 that was still present in the Rh(II)-3 sample. Digestion of Rh(II)-3 followed by solution ¹H-NMR analysis did not reveal the presence of any remaining Rh(III)-Me. However, considering the higher sensitivity of EPR compared to NMR, we cannot rule out that the carbon-based radical trapped by PBN corresponds to methyl radicals derived from Rh(Me)-3 impurities in Rh(II)-3. EPR analysis of recovered catalyst samples also repeatedly showed peaks of varying intensity with g = 2, which could indicate the presence of a porphyrin centered radical or a Rh superoxo species.⁴⁹ While prior EPR studies of porphyrin-containing MOFs have attributed similar features to porphyrin centered radicals,¹²,⁵⁰ we also observed the presence of the signal in question for 3 which had never been subjected to hydrosilylation catalysis (Figure 6E). Considering all available data, we conclude that radical addition to the porphyrin linker may take place, but we cannot comment to the extent or reversibility of this process. Should the porphyrin linker
in 3 undergo derivatization, however, it does not appear to affect its catalytic performance, at least within the first 8 uses of the catalyst.

Assistance by Adjacent Rh Center

While we had gathered various pieces of experimental evidence that the presence of ethylene enables H–Si bond cleavage at room temperature, a transition state model constructed based on the existing data delivered an unrealistically high calculated Gibbs energy of activation (Figure 9A). Considering that thermal hydrosilylation with Rh(II)–3 can occur at room temperature, it cannot be associated with Gibbs energy of activation that substantially exceeds ~20 kcal·mol⁻¹. Numerous alternative proposed transition structures also furnished unrealistically high activation barriers or could not be located by our computational approach (Figure S55). Since initial models only considered one isolated Rh(II) porphyrin center, we considered that the discrepancy may arise from the promotional effects of the extended environment. Interestingly, when a second Rh(II) porphyrin center was positioned at the distance set by the MOF framework, an electron transfer from the Rh-H-Si-ethylene adduct to the adjacent Rh(II) center could take place. Electron transfer gave rise to a zwitterionic transition state (Figure 9B) that was slightly lower in energy than the neutral transition state (Figure 9A). Prior EPR studies had shown however that simultaneous addition of silane and ethylene to Rh(II)–3 led to the formation of bis-adduct 13 (Figure 7). Trans-ligation of Rh by an electron-donating ligand would be expected to stabilize the cationic Rh center present in a zwitterionic transition state (Figure 9B) and thus lower the barrier associated with it. Theoretical models indicated that, while an ethylene adduct is accessible, it is 4.7 kcal·mol⁻¹ less stable than a benzene adduct of 6. However, the increased electron donation provided by ethylene compared to benzene as the trans ligand on Rh(II) led to superior stabilization of the transiently positively charged transition structure. Even taking into account the estimated energy penalty of 4.7 kcal·mol⁻¹ for the formation of 13, the transition state structure depicted in Figure 9D gave rise to the lowest barrier observed thus far (29.7 kcal·mol⁻¹). Interestingly, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analysis showed that the electron transfer from the ethylene adduct of 13 to an adjacent Rh(II) center occurs immediately prior to the transition state (Figure 9C). Shortly after the barrier is crossed, a second electron transfer takes place which returns both Rh centers to an oxidation state of two (Figure S62). While the theoretical model now accounted for the promotional effect of an adjacent rhodium center, it did not reproduce the polarity of the extended environment. Since computation of an entire MOF pore at even the DFT level with a double zeta basis set was too expensive, we accounted for the higher polarity of the MOF pore environment versus a benzene solvent environment via a correction to the dielectric constant in the solvent model (Table S23). Use of a dielectric constant consistent with the calculated polarizability of the MOF, as well as complete filling of the MOF’s pores by benzene, furnished a theoretical Gibbs energy of activation of 24.9 kcal·mol⁻¹.

While the theoretical model clearly highlighted the beneficial effect of a second Rh(II) center in close proximity to the active site, the computed reaction pathway was not yet consistent with a transformation that could take place at room temperature. Notably, however, the theoretical model does not account for the presence of Rh(III)-O-H within the MOF pore. While the beneficial effect of the presence of these polar groups could be clearly established experimentally, their absolute concentration or spatial distribution is not known, which precluded inclusion in the theoretical model. Importantly, however, a number of experimentally testable hypotheses result from the lowest energy pathway provided by theoretical calculations: i) the involvement of ethylene in the highest energy transition state suggests that thermal hydrosilylation is associated with an ethylene order of at least 1, likely even 2 (if ethylene serves as the trans ligand on Rh(II) as depicted in Figure 9D), ii) a polar solvent environment would be expected to stabilize the partial charges created in the transition state of the thermal hydrosilylation reaction, and iii) the amount of dehydrosilylated side product obtained would be expected to be higher for the thermal pathway due to the possibility of facile proton loss from the zwitterionic transition structure.
mediated reaction at room temperature is thus expected to be dominated by the selectivity associated with the silyl radical reaction pathway. When the photochemical reaction is carried out at 50 °C, the contribution of the thermal pathway becomes substantial and the selectivity for the formation of the hydrosilylated product drops to 93%. The formation of an increased amount of hydrosilylated product whenever the thermal reaction pathway is a dominant contributor to the reaction rate is consistent with the zwiterionic transition state depicted in Figure 9C. We also investigated the origin of the substantially lower selectivity observed in light-mediated hydrosilylation with the molecular analogue of Rh(III)-3, the results of which are discussed in the Supporting Information (Figure S70).

Kinetic Isotope Effect

To assess whether kinetic analysis of ethylene hydrosilylation would shed light on the rate determining transition state or would instead be overshadowed by mass transport limitations, we determined the kinetic isotope effect. The formation of the σ-adduct, which is the only step preceding Si–H cleavage, is not associated with any notable weakening of the Si–H bond and therefore does not show a significant equilibrium isotope effect. Consequently, the experimental kinetic isotope effect (KIE) could be determined by direct competition of HSiEt₃ and DSiEt₃, which ensures higher accuracy for a heterogeneous (light-mediated) reaction than would be possible for the comparison of absolute rate constants. Determination of the H:D ratios for tetraethylsilane formed in the presence of both HSiEt₃ and DSiEt₃ furnished a KIE of 1.85 ± 0.24 for light-mediated hydrosilylation and 1.90 ± 0.25 for thermal hydrosilylation with Rh(II)-3 (Table S24–S25). The KIE was identical within experimental error for the light-mediated and the dark reaction. A KIE of 1.9 ± 0.25 substantiated that Si–H cleavage takes place in the turnover limiting step, which is the case for both reaction pathways we have outlined. Furthermore, the experimental kinetic isotope effect is in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted value of 1.9 for the dark reaction (Figure S69). Notably, because the experimental intermolecular KIE is not substantially lowered compared with theoretical predictions, mass transfer of the silane through the MOF pore network is not limiting the reaction rate.

Reaction Orders and Eyring Analysis

During kinetic investigations of thermal olefin hydrosilylation we had to rely on analysis of reaction aliquots because mass transfer limitations were observed when thermal hydrosilylation was carried out inside an NMR tube. Interestingly, even the dissolution of ethylene could become substantially inhibited within narrow vessels. In-situ monitoring of ethylene hydrosilylation reaction catalyzed by Rh(II)-3 led to an abrupt cessation of conversion once the ~0.6 equivalents of ethylene initially dissolved in the reaction solvent were converted, despite the availability of additional ethylene in the headspace of the NMR tube (Figure S11). We could confirm ethylene dissolution limitations by EPR, were the concentration of 13 detected was strongly dependent on the extent to which EPR tubes were shaken (Figure S12). Determination of reaction orders was thus carried out in standard reaction vials from which aliquots were repeatedly collected for NMR analysis. A change in the olefin substrate from ethylene to 1-pentene was deemed necessary to prevent escape of ethylene during sampling. A catalyst reaction order of one, as well as a silane reaction order of 1.3 could be determined by reaction progress kinetic analysis via graphical overlap developed by Blackmond and Bures (Figure S74–S81). Reaction order analysis for 1-pentene led to a value of 0.7, but due to the larger variability within data sets collected for 1-pentene, we could only conclude that the 1-pentene order was non-zero and likely ~1 (Figure S82–S84). The reaction orders determined are consistent with a rate-limiting transition state that involves Rh(II)-3, silane, as well as olefin. Notably, theoretical calculations suggest that the coordination of an electron-donating substituent such as ethylene or silane in the trans position of the Rh(II) porphyrin leads to a substantial reduction in calculated Gibbs energy of activation. Based on EPR observation of intermediate 13, ethylene was used as an exemplary ligand for all theoretical analyses. However, the experimentally determined 1-pentene order of ~1 excluded 1-pentene coordination in the trans position of Rh(II) during 1-pentene hydrosilylation. We suspect that the increased steric bulk of 1-pentene compared to ethylene could disfavor π-coordination of 1-pentene, so that silane likely occupies the axial coordination site on Rh(II). A silane order of 1.3 is consistent with the participation of more than one silane molecule in the generation of transition state, and theoretical calculations indicate that occupation of the trans position on Rh(II) by silane instead of benzene solvent reduces the reaction barrier by 7.4 kcal·mol⁻¹ (Table S21). The slower hydrosilylation rate observed with 1-pentene versus ethylene is consistent with reduced stabilization of a zwiterionic transition structure due to the less efficient electron-donation from a silane compared to an ethylene ligand to Rh(II).

Since the replacement of ethylene with a non-gaseous olefin led to noticeable reduction in the reaction rate, we determined the experimental Gibbs energy of activation for the hydrosilylation of ethylene itself to permit comparison between experimental and computational data. It was practically challenging to obtain temperature dependent kinetic data for a reaction that requires a solid catalyst, liquid as well as gaseous reagents, and for which the oxygen concentration has a substantial effect on the reaction rate, so that the quality of the data obtained was only modest (Table S29–S31). Nonetheless, experimental activation parameters of ΔGO_exp (298 K) = 19.4 ± 0.6 kcal·mol⁻¹, and ΔH_exp = 17.6 ± 2.7 kcal·mol⁻¹ could be extracted from an Eyring analysis (Table S32–S33, see section 21.2 in SI). To consider the possibility that ethylene may serve as the trans ligand for Rh(II) in ethylene hydrosilylation, we calculated ΔGO_exp both for an olefin order of 1 (the experimentally determined value for 1-pentene) as well as 2 (based on the theoretical proposal for ethylene), which led to values of ΔGO_exp = 20.0 kcal·mol⁻¹ (ethylene order = 1) and ΔGO_exp = 18.8 kcal·mol⁻¹ (ethylene order = 2), respectively. Consequently, even the upper end of the error range for ΔGO_exp is substantially below the minimum barrier required to promote hydrosilylation via silyl...
radical intermediates. It must be stated, however, that direct comparison of the numerical values for the barriers does not provide immediate information on the practical feasibility of the two reaction pathways due to a difference in reaction orders. Unlike the rate of olefin hydrosilylation via the intermediacy of silyl radicals, which would not be expected to depend on the olefin concentration, direct silyl transfer to olefins has a non-zero olefin order, so that low concentrations of olefin could lead to a low reaction rate even for low values of \( \Delta G^{\text{exp}} \).

Solvent Effect

Based on the mechanism proposed for direct silyl radical transfer, a rate acceleration would be expected when the polarity of the solvent is increased: Electron transfer from the adjacent porphyrin center leads to the generation of charges in the transition state, so that a polar solvent environment would be expected to stabilize the transition structure. To ensure that any observed rate differences were not caused by varying ethylene concentrations in solution, we selected a number of solvents for which the experimentally determined ethylene solubility fell into a narrow range (Table S42).\(^{57}\) For \( n \)-hexane, benzene, chlorobenzene, and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), the total amount of ethylene present during experiments corresponded to 2.2 - 2.5 equivalents relative to silane, of which 0.5 - 0.8 equiv were present in solution. Hexane, which showed the highest ethylene solubility but has the lowest dielectric constant (\( \varepsilon = 1.88 \)),\(^{57}\) gave rise to slower silane conversion (Figure 10). On the other hand, replacement of benzene with HFIP (\( \varepsilon = 16.7 \)) increased the conversion to above 80% after a reaction time of 20 h. We also examined ethylene hydrosilylation in HFIP with Rh(II)-3 prepared in the presence of 1 mL of air: complete conversion was observed after 20 h, and even after 5 h, a conversion of 32% had already been reached (Figure 10). We attribute the rate enhancement to the formation of a larger number of Rh(III)-O-OH sites that may provide internal solvation to polar transition structures assembled on adjacent Rh(II) centers. The observation of a pronounced oxygen effect in a polar solvent such as HFIP suggests that solvent molecules in the pore cannot fully compensate for the polar stabilization Rh(III)-O-OH moieties provide to the zwitterionic transition state.

DISCUSSION

We embarked on a systematic study to understand why Rh(II) porphyrin centers site isolated in a MOF host were able to promote thermal hydrosilylation of olefins, whereas structurally analogous molecular catalysts proved unreactive. One potential challenge with the molecular catalyst is that the dimerization via Rh–Rh bond formation readily takes place, which depletes the concentration of Rh(II) porphyrin. Preserving a monomeric Rh(II) species in solution is insufficient, however, because no thermal hydrosilylation is observed either with 1, which is sterically shielded from Rh–Rh bond formation. While steric bulk is effective for preventing Rh–Rh bond formation, it offers poor protection for 3c-3e adducts: Even the extreme steric protection offered by four 2,6-disopropyl phenyl substituents was only able to stabilize a porphyrin Rh(II)-ethylene 3c-3e adduct at low temperatures. The geometric protection offered by the MOF matrix permits the formation of a 3c-3e ethylene \( \pi \)-adduct, and even a 3c-3e silane \( \sigma \)-adduct that both remain stable at room temperature. The combination of stability and steric accessibility of the novel 3c-3e silane \( \sigma \)-adduct 6 permits it to engage with other reaction partners, such as olefins. Pre-assembly of silane and Rh(II) to form 6 renders it entropically feasible to assemble a tri-component transition state in which the C-Si bond is formed in concert with formation of the Rh–H bond and cleavage of the H–Si bond. For a molecular complex in solution, a corresponding tri-component transition state is entropically inaccessible because no 3c-3e silane \( \sigma \)-adduct adduct can be generated. Site-isolation alone is however insufficient to enable facile direct silyl radical transfer: We found that an electron transfer that takes place as the system approaches the transition state is necessary to enable olefin hydrosilylation to take place at room temperature. While isolated Rh(II) centers could potentially be obtained by attachment of suitably functionalized Rh(II) porphyrin molecules to a support surface, the high degree of spatial organization provided by the MOF host is crucial for ensuring that a Rh(II) center is sufficiently close to a transition structure to engage in facile electron transfer. Additionally, we also found evidence for an unexpected stabilization of the transition structure due to the formation of Rh(III)-O-OH during photolysis of the Rh(Me) precatalyst. Small amounts of O\(_2\) exert a pronounced beneficial effect on thermal ethylene hydrosilylation, which we rationalized by considering that the co-generation of minor amounts of Rh(III)-O-OH alongside Rh(II) would position polar groups in close spatial proximity to the active site. The promotional effect of Rh(III)-O-OH remained pronounced when benzene was replaced by HFIP as the reaction solvent, which suggests the effect of proximally located Rh(III)-O-OH is not trivial to recreate via variation of the solvent environment. Notably, both the observation of substantial rate increases in the presence of a polar solvent, and an increase in the formation of the dehydrosilylated reaction products support that electron transfer from an adjacent rhodium center occurs during thermal hydrosilylation.

In an attempt to quantify the beneficial effect that the MOF host imparts on olefin hydrosilylation catalysis, we considered the minimum energy pathways that would enable hy-

CONCLUSION

We have shown that olefin hydrosilylation catalyzed by site isolated Rh(II) metalloradicals 3 or 4 can proceed via two pathways, both of which involve 3c-3e silane σ-adduct 6. In the presence of light, free silyl radicals are generated from 6, which subsequently add to olefins. H-atom transfer between the resulting carbon-centered radical and Rh(III)-H regenerates the active Rh(II) catalyst. In the absence of light, however, the σ-adduct 6 is stable at room temperature both in the dry state and when suspended in benzene. Intermediate 6 pre-organizes Rh(II) and silane for participation in a tri-component transition structure with olefins that permits facile thermal hydrosilylation. By synchronizing Rh-H bond formation, H-Si bond cleavage and Si-C bond formation, the direct silyl transfer pathway limits the number of high-energy intermediates that need to be formed over the course of the reaction. The MOF-based catalyst, which has access to a direct silyl transfer pathway from intermediate 6 can thus promote hydrosilylation at room temperature, while a molecular analogue which was unable to stabilize a 3c-3e silane σ-adduct furnished negligible amounts of product even at 140 °C.
