ABSTRACT

The chemical and structural properties of atomically precise nanoclusters are of great interest in numerous applications, but the structures of the clusters can be computationally expensive to predict. In this work, we present the largest database of cluster structures and properties determined using ab-initio methods to date. We report the methodologies used to discover low-energy clusters as well as the energies, relaxed structures, and physical properties (such as relative stability, HOMO-LUMO gap among others) for over 50,000 clusters across 55 elements. We have identified 589 structures which have energies lower than any previously reported in the literature by at least 1 meV/atom, and we have identified 1340 new structures for clusters that were previously unexplored in the literature. Patterns in the data reveal insights into the chemical and structural relationships among the elements at the nanoscale. We describe how the database can be accessed for future studies and the development of nanocluster-based technologies.

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY

Small nanoclusters possess novel physical properties which differ from those of their bulk counterparts, including discrete energy levels [1, 2], nonlinear optical properties [3], magnetism [4], high catalytic activity [5-7], multiple absorption bands [7, 8], and enhanced photoluminescence [9-12]. These properties emerge as a consequence of their small size and relatively high number of uncoordinated atoms on the surface, and they can be tuned by altering the size and shape of the cluster [13, 14]. The past few decades have shown significant progress in computational methods to predict these properties, but before a property can be calculated it is necessary to first determine the atomic structure of the cluster. A number of algorithms have been developed to predict the ground state atomic structure by comprehensively sampling the potential energy surface (PES) of the cluster. These methods include genetic algorithms [15-17], simulated annealing [18], particle swarm optimization [19], Bayesian optimization [20] and basin-hopping [21] methods. In each of these methods, identification of the ground state structure is accomplished by first calculating the energies of a large number of candidate structures and then selecting the structures with the lowest energies.

Due in part to strong quantum finite-size effects, accurate determination of the relative cluster energies is best accomplished using ab-initio calculations, and the number of low-energy configurational isomers is estimated to grow exponentially with the number of atoms in the cluster [22, 23]. For these reasons searching for the ground state atomic structure can be computationally demanding. An alternative approach to identifying low-energy structures is to search through a reference database of known
structures. In recent years, materials databases for crystalline materials have transformed materials research [24-28]. However, current nanocluster structure datasets are either unavailable to the public, limited in scope, or primarily utilize lower levels of theory like interatomic potential models [29-32] and tight binding models [33].

Here we present a database of low-energy cluster structures for 55 elements, for clusters of 3-55 atoms, calculated using density functional theory (DFT) [34]. The database contains structures obtained through an ab-initio genetic algorithm, an accelerated genetic algorithm using machine-learned interatomic potentials, regression analysis of chemically similar elements, and a survey of the scientific literature. The structures from the scientific literature include 3131 nanoclusters from the Cambridge Cluster Database [33], which were identified using interatomic potentials. The 55 elements encompass different regions of the periodic table, including alkali and alkaline earth metals, transition metals, post transition metals, metalloids, and non-metals. Although we are continuing to add to this data set, to the best of our knowledge, this dataset already constitutes the most extensive collection of computed cluster structures at the DFT level of theory. The data set can be used to guide experimental synthesis of predicted nanoclusters, to guide searches for low-energy clusters in different chemical environments, to computationally screen for clusters suitable for a variety of applications, or to train machine learning models. Since the structural energies were obtained using a consistent computational method, the data also serves as a direct source for comparative benchmark studies of different DFT or other electronic structure techniques within the context of atomic cluster modelling. All atomic structures and their calculated properties are openly distributed, enabling researchers across the world to access it for free and use it for further analysis.

METHODS

We have used the following methods to populate the Quantum Cluster Database with atomically precise nanoclusters:

1. We have searched the literature for coordinates of previously-discovered candidate low-energy clusters. The atomic structures and their literature sources are summarized in Table 1 and SI Figure S1.

2. We have used a genetic algorithm with ab-initio calculations. This method was primarily used to identify some of the structures for elements that are computationally cheap as determined by the number of valence electrons in the projector augmented wave potentials used (Table S1 in SI), such as Mg, Li, Sb, Na, Ga, and Si. The details of the genetic algorithm method can be found in SI section 1 as well as in reference [35].

3. We have used a genetic algorithm accelerated by actively learned moment tensor potentials (MTP)[36-39] trained on-the-fly. This method has been used to find S clusters of sizes 51, 52, and 53 and we are currently using it to find additional clusters for B, P, and C.

4. We have used correlations in the total energies of different elements to predict low-energy clusters for one element from known low-energy structures of chemically similar elements.

A brief description of each of these methods is provided below, with additional details in the SI Section 1 and 2.
Low-energy structures mined from existing literature

Many of the clusters in the QCD have been studied before, including systematic DFT studies of small [40] and large clusters [41] across different elements. We collected the atomic structures of clusters from publications that provide atomic coordinates of reported low-energy structures, as calculated using DFT, and from the Cambridge Cluster Database, which consists primarily of structures discovered using empirical potentials. All structures from the literature were relaxed using our DFT settings as described in the section on DFT calculations. In Table 1, we provide the literature references for these cluster structures grouped by element.

Low-energy structures from a genetic algorithm

Low-energy cluster structures were also identified by means of a genetic algorithm (GA)[80, 81], an optimization algorithm based on natural evolution in which beneficial characteristics prevail over successive generations. In our implementation, a GA run begins by populating a pool of clusters with random structures and/or seed structures assembled from previous GA run. All cluster energies are evaluated by relaxing the atomic positions using DFT[34]. Child clusters are generated from pool clusters by using two types of operations: crossover, in which parts of each parent cluster are combined to form a child cluster, and mutation, in which a subset of atoms of a cluster structure are randomly moved. If a child cluster has lower energy than the highest-energy pool cluster and is not structurally equivalent to other pool clusters, it replaces the highest-energy cluster of the pool. The cycle continues until the total number of clusters in the GA run is at least 1000. Additional details of the genetic algorithm method can be found in SI section 1 as well as reference [82].

Learning on the Fly (LOTF)-GA

We have recently developed a way to accelerate the genetic algorithm using machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on-the-fly using active learning [35-37]. The machine-learned interatomic potentials are used to quickly identify likely low-energy clusters, which are further relaxed locally by DFT to refine the energies. This method has been used to identify low-energy structures for S clusters of size 51, 52, and 53. Additional details about this method can be found in reference [35].

Correlations between energies for different elements

We have constructed additional low-energy cluster structures by taking advantage of the fact that for some elements there are strong correlations between the total energies of geometrically similar cluster structures. To identify these relationships, we created 55 representative cluster structure prototypes (available in the SI) in a two-step process.

In the first step, we used the genetic algorithm to identify the low energy structures for clusters of 5, 10, 15 and 20 atoms of Al, Be, Li, Mg, Na, Si, Ta, and Ti clusters. These elements were chosen because they cover different parts of the periodic table and are computationally inexpensive relative to others because of the small numbers of valence electrons. The low energy configurations are provided in the supporting information.

In the second step, we used these clusters as templates to create clusters of all the other elements. For each target element, the interatomic distances in the cluster were scaled by the ratio of the nearest neighbor distance of the target element and the template element. The nearest neighbor distances (Table S2) are the bond distances in their most stable bulk form and are retrieved from the Materials Project [26]. To identify a chemically diverse set of elements, we used least-squares regression to express the unrelaxed DFT-calculated cluster energies for each element as a linear combination of the energies of the remaining 54 elements. The residual errors for these fits provide a measure of the extent by which each element is different from the other 54 elements. We selected the 13 elements with the highest errors: B, Ba, Be, Ca, Cr, Cs, K, Li, Mg, Na, Rb, Sr, and Zn, as these are likely to have distinct ground state structures. We then used the genetic algorithm to search for low-energy structures for clusters of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 atoms.
for these 13 elements. The low-energy structures discovered by the genetic algorithm are shown in Figure 1, and their coordinates are provided in the supporting information. These 65 structures were used as structural templates for determining relationships between structural energies among different elements.

To evaluate the diversity of the 65 template structures, we compared the clusters using a structural similarity score as described in reference [83], where perfectly similar structures have a score of 0.0, and we consider structures with a score above 0.3 to be dissimilar. Across the 5 different sizes and 13 different elements, only five pairs have a similarity score less than 0.3, indicating that the remaining pairs of structures are structurally distinct.

After discovering low-energy clusters with the genetic algorithm, we filled gaps on the database (i.e., elements and sizes where no clusters were available) using the correlations among the energies of the elements. For a gap of a given element and size, we identified the most correlated element and used its 5 lowest-energy clusters of the same size as templates to generate new clusters that were likely to have low energy. We followed the process of re-scaling the interatomic distances using the bulk nearest-neighbor bond length.

DFT calculations

All DFT local energy minimizations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation exchange-correlation functional. We used the projector-augmented wave [86] method, with the potentials listed in Table S2 in the SI. The convergence criterion for electronic self-consistency was set to $10^{-5}$ eV per cluster. Structures were optimized using the conjugate gradient approximation [87, 88] as implemented in VASP until all the atomic forces were less than 0.15 eV/Å. All calculations were run at the gamma point with spin polarization. Methfessel Paxton smearing [89] with $\sigma = 0.001$ eV was used to achieve high accuracy when calculating final energies. To accelerate convergence for some clusters, a two-step minimizations scheme was adopted with smearing of 0.1 eV in the initial step for faster convergence and a smaller value of 0.001 eV for the final step. Symmetry was turned off for all DFT calculations to increase the likelihood that the calculation completed successfully.

To determine the effect of Spin Orbit Coupling (SOC) on predicting final energies, we performed PBE+SOC for 11 different heavy-metal elements selected based on ref [41]. As we found the inclusion of SOC had little effect on the ranking of low-energy structures, to maintain the consistency of the QCD data we have not included SOC-predicted total energies and atomic structures in the QCD database. More discussion of the effects of SOC, including simple linear equations for estimating SOC-calculated energies from the energies reported in the QCD, can be found in section 5 and section 6 of the SI.

Workflow

We identify candidate low-energy cluster structures using one of the four methods listed above. DFT calculations were performed on these clusters structures before adding them to the database. An outline of the high-throughput workflow used in these DFT calculations is provided in Figure 3. In the first step we check whether the ionic relaxation has converged. If it has not, we rerun the relaxation with modified VASP settings such as increased wall time or a different optimization algorithm.

All DFT calculations were performed using VASP which can only do periodic calculations, so each cluster is in effect surrounded by translationally equivalent clusters. Hence it is essential to use a simulation cell that is sufficiently large to avoid interaction among periodic images. We found that this was best accomplished using two different criteria for different sets of elements. For elements in the Groups 1A and 2A on the periodic table, the minimum distance between neighboring clusters must be greater than 3.5 times the distance between nearest neighbor listed in Table S3 in the SI. For all other elements the minimum distance between periodic images must be greater than 10 angstroms. If, after relaxation, the minimum distance between neighboring clusters was too small, then we increased the supercell size and ran the DFT calculation again. We found that these "box size" criteria are sufficient to reach energy convergence within 2 meV/atom in all 1135 tested cases (please see Figure S8 and additional details in the SI) with a root mean squared error of 0.118 meV/atom.

The atoms sometimes form periodic configurations that correspond to nanowires or slabs. We filter out these types of structures by discarding clusters that have a minimum distance between periodic images
smaller than 1.5 times the atomic nearest neighbor distance. We also screen for discontiguous clusters using this same criterion and discard any discontiguous clusters that are identified.

To ensure the Quantum Cluster Database contains only unique clusters for a given element and size, when two clusters have a structural similarity score [83] less than 0.3, the cluster with higher energy is discarded. If the higher-energy cluster was from the literature, the appropriate literature references are assigned to the structurally similar low-energy cluster. All the filters that ensures the quality of the clusters in the database are summarized in the Figure 3.

The properties and metadata described in the Data Records section are calculated for each cluster and stored in a PostgreSQL database. Finally, the data are displayed in the Quantum Cluster Database website and output as a JSON file and a .csv file.

DFT calculations on magnetic clusters

We used spin polarized calculations with default magnetic initializations (1 \( \mu_B \) /atom) for all elements other than Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, V, Cu, and Cr. We found that the final magnetic states for Fe, Mn, Ni, Ru, Rh, V, and Cr clusters are particularly likely to depend on the magnetic initialization. To increase the likelihood of relaxing into the lowest-energy magnetic state for these elements we run multiple calculations with different magnetic initializations, as listed in Table S4. The calculations that yields the lowest energy is selected for inclusion in the QCD. Based on benchmarks on 2228 clusters of above-mentioned elements selected from an early version of the QCD, we found that this approach yielded the lowest-energy magnetic state more than 97% of the time. For clusters of Cu and Co, we find that the magnetic initializations with 3 \( \mu_B \) /atom relaxed into lowest energy configurations in all of our benchmark calculations. Additional details of the magnetic initializations are provided in section 2 of the SI.

**File format**

The data is available for download as a JSON file and as a .csv file. Both can be downloaded from the Quantum Cluster Database website. The first level of the JSON file contains a unique index for every cluster, the next level contains the cluster_id described in Table 2, and the next level contains the other keys described in Table 2, with the corresponding values. The columns of the .csv file correspond to the keys described in Table 2. The VASP DFT calculation files for each cluster are available in the NOMAD repository in the form of text files from the inputs and outputs of VASP.
Properties

For each cluster of a given number of atoms $N$ and element type $k$, the database contains the energy relative to the lowest energy structure of size $N$ and species $k$, the formation energy with respect to the stable cluster of size $N-1$ of species $k$ (equation (1)), the formation energy with respect to the $N+1$ stable cluster of the same species (equation (2)), the HOMO-LUMO gap, the number of valence electrons considered by DFT, the magnetic moment, a list of similar structures within the Quantum Cluster Database, a list of literature references for the cluster (downloadable in .bib format), the coordinates (downloadable in XYZ format), and an interactive visualization of the cluster. The formation energies are calculated using the following equations:

\[
E_{f,N,N-1} = E_N - E_{N-1} - E_{\text{atom}} \quad (1)
\]

\[
E_{f,N,N+1} = E_N + E_{\text{atom}} - E_{N+1} \quad (2)
\]

where $E_N$ is the energy of the cluster of size $N$, $E_{N-1}$ is the energy of the cluster of size $N-1$, $E_{N+1}$ is the energy of the cluster of size $N+1$, and $E_{\text{atom}}$ is the energy of an isolated atom. The energies for isolated atoms used in these calculations are provided in Table S3 of the SI.

TECHNICAL VALIDATION

Figure 4. Histogram of energy differences between the lowest-energy clusters reported in the literature (minus 1 meV/atom to account for DFT precision) and the lowest-energy clusters in the QCD. The Quantum Cluster Database contains 589 clusters that have a lower energy than the lowest-energy clusters from the literature.
For a given cluster size and element, we compared the lowest-energy cluster from the literature against the lowest-energy non-literature cluster in the database to assess which had lower energy. There are 1540 systems for which there is at least one literature structure in the database. The database contains clusters that are lower in energy by at least 1 meV/atom for 589 of these (Figure 5).

The Quantum Cluster Database contains 1483 structure types or templates (i.e., relative arrangements of atoms) that were not previously reported in the literature. The 1483 templates were identified from the set of all clusters with calculated energies within 1 meV/atom of the lowest energy cluster with the same element and size. In comparison, there are 684 templates of low-energy templates from the literature (Table 1).

**Figure 5.** A summary of previous studies of the structures of elemental clusters with 3-55 atoms, including publications that used DFT to find atomic structures (green and blue) as well as systems covered in the Cambridge Cluster Database (grey and blue). The Quantum Cluster Database covers these clusters as well as 1340 regions that were previously unexplored (shown in orange).
Before our work, here were 1575 cluster elements and sizes covered by the literature out of 2915, which corresponds to 54%. With the Quantum Cluster Database, the percentage covered increased to 100%.

1. Identifying low energy clusters using the genetic algorithm

Low-energy atomic structures of clusters were identified using a genetic algorithm (GA), a global optimization technique inspired by the principles of natural selection [1]. We implemented our own GA code based off the Birmingham Parallel Genetic Algorithm (BPGA) with some variations [2, 3]. Figure S2 shows a schematic workflow of the genetic algorithm, details of which are described in our previous work [4].

The majority of GA searches in this work were performed using GA with pure DFT calculations (referred as GA_DFT in our previous work [5]). We evaluated multiple variations of the genetic algorithm as we filled the database. The final parameters and workflow were the same as we reported in reference [5], with some exceptions. First, we used a pool size of 10 and stopped the GA once the total number of clusters reached 1000. We also included “seeding” as a genetic operation in GA searches for sulfur clusters, with the ratios of pool clusters generated from seeding, mutation and crossover operations equal to 1:1:3. In the seeding operation, new structures are generated from seed structures which are typically known low-energy structures with different numbers of atoms. Atoms are either randomly added or subtracted from the seed structure until it reaches the target size. Seeding was included for sulfur clusters more than 10 atoms to reduce the chance of clusters being relaxed into discontiguous forms. Low-energy sulfur clusters with N atoms were used to seed searches for clusters with N+1 to N+5 atoms. For large sulfur clusters with 52 and 53 atoms, we initialized them as zig-zag rings, as suggested by the morphology of stable small-size clusters, and then collected the ones that are contiguous after relaxed by DFT. We accelerated the GA search for sulfur clusters with 51, 52, and 53 atoms with on-the-fly active learning (termed as “GA_AL” in our previous work [4]).

In the energy evaluation by DFT during the GA runs, we set the side length of each simulation box to ensure a distance of at least 10 angstroms between periodic images. For Na, K, Rb, Cs, Mg, Sr, and Ba, the distances are increased to at least 15 angstroms because they have larger atomic radii compared with the rest.

2. DFT Calculation strategies for treating magnetic clusters

The final magnetic state of a cluster may be in a local minimum that is not the global minimum. To reduce the chance of this happening, for each of the magnetic elements (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, V, Cu, and Cr) we evaluated the effect of using different initial magnetic moments (+1 $\mu_B$/atom, +2 $\mu_B$/atom, +3 $\mu_B$/atom, and +5 $\mu_B$/atom), as set using the MAGMOM parameter in VASP. We evaluated the final magnetic states and energies of 2228 clusters with between 3-55 atoms selected from an early version of the QCD. We found that for some elements (e.g. Co) the final state is almost always independent of MAGMOM, whereas for others (e.g. Cr) it is common for the cluster to get trapped in local minima, making it important to initialize with multiple MAGMOM values. Often clusters with an odd-number of electrons would have a net magnetic moment of 1 $\mu_B$ per cluster, and clusters with an even number of electrons would have a net magnetic moment of 0 $\mu_B$, but this behavior was largely independent of MAGMOM. In Table S4, we list the elements which retain non-zero magnetic moments after relaxation as well as the effects of multiple magnetic initializations (as shown in Table S5) on magnetic moments after relaxation.

For each element we selected a subset of MAGMOM values that included the lowest DFT energy for a given size (within 1 meV/atom) at least 97% of the time (Table S4). These values were used to initialize the DFT calculations. For elements for which multiple MAGMOM values were used, for each cluster the calculation that resulted in the lowest energy was added to the database.

3. Effect of Spin Orbit Coupling

To determine whether it is necessary to use spin-orbit-coupling (SOC) to identify low-energy structures for heavy-metal elements, we performed additional PBE + SOC calculations on the lowest energy clusters of 11 different heavy-metal elements (Au, Bi, Hf, Hg, Ir, Os, Pb, Pt, Re, Ta, and Tl) with sizes ranging from 3 to 55 atoms. Additionally, we choose the six (where available) lowest energy isomers for small (size 10), medium (size 30), and large (size 55) clusters to study the effect of SOC on relative ordering. The PBE+SOC calculated energies linearly correlated with PBE computed energies (Figure S3). We also developed a cheap proxy to evaluate PBE+SOC computed energies from PBE computed energies for these 11 different elements using linear regression. The conversion factors (slope and intercept) for converting PBE+SOC energies from PBE energies for these elements are provided in Figure S4. We also found that the use of SOC has little effect on the energetic rankings of isomers (Figure S5, Figure S6, and Figure S7). For these reasons, and to maintain consistency in the database, we have not included the effects of SOC in the calculated energies in the QCD. For three small clusters (with compositions Pb\textsubscript{10}, Tl\textsubscript{10} and Hf\textsubscript{10}), the PBE + SOC calculations relaxed to clusters that were structurally dissimilar to the relaxed PBE structures (as determined by similarity scores greater than 0.3). Because the energies for the two methods were not calculated for the same structure, these clusters are excluded from the comparisons in Figure S5, Figure S6 and Figure S7.

Figure S5. Effect of PBE + SOC on relative energy ordering among isomers of Au, Bi, Hf, Hg, and Ir clusters. Relative energies with respect to the lowest energy isomers are plotted for each polymorph, and the polymorphs are sorted based on the PBE+SOC energies. One Hf$_{10}$ structure was not included in this plot because PBE and PBE-SOC relaxed to dissimilar structures.

Relative energies with respect to lowest energy isomer are plotted against each polymorph which is sorted w.r.t PBE+SOC energies. One Pb_{10} structure was not included in this plot because PBE and PBE-SOC relaxed to dissimilar structures.
Figure S7. Effect of PBE +SOC on relative energy ordering among the isomers of TI clusters. Element name and their sizes are stamped in each subplot. Relative energies with respect to lowest energy isomer are plotted against each polymorph which is sorted w.r.t PBE+SOC energies. One TI_{10} structure was not included in this plot because PBE and PBE-SOC relaxed to dissimilar structures.

5. Box Size Analysis

To investigate whether the box sizes used in the QCD are sufficiently large, we performed benchmarks on 1335 clusters from 49 different elements with 3-55 atoms selected from the QCD. In all cases, energies were converged within 2 meV/atom, with a root mean square box size error of just 0.118 meV/atom.
