Abstract: Given the significant prevalence of \(N\)-heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals, the selective incorporation of a difluoromethyl (−CF\(_2\)H) motif and the creation of a new functional group within the same molecular framework are of paramount importance in drug discovery and development. However, such integrated approaches remain underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient synthetic methods. In the present research, we introduce a new platform and broadly applicable technique for the difluoromethylation of various \(N\)-heterocyclic substrates using low-cost and commercially available bromo(difluoro)acetic acid in the presence of K\(_2\)CO\(_3\) at room temperature to produce >70 desired complex Het−NCF\(_2\)H products featuring either imine and/or ketone functional group, which were hitherto impossible to produce. Depending on the type of \(N\)-heterocycle, this advance also permits the inclusion of two CF\(_2\)H units. Crucial to success is the more nucleophilicity and less steric hindrance on the nitrogen atom of the heteroarene ring that enables \(N\)-difluoromethylative dearomatization of \(N\)-heterocycles. Overall, this unique transformation was transition metal-free, practical, scalable (>50 grams), tolerant to diverse reactive functional groups with excellent chemoselectivity, adaptable to diversities of challenging \(N\)-heteroaromatic ring systems, and could be used for the late-stage diversification of 18 commercial drug molecules. Mechanistic investigation revealed the formation of \(N\)-difluoromethylquinolinium salt as a key intermediate, which occurs via nucleophilic substitution followed by decarboxylation with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid. Ultimately, we have also unveiled a prominent synthetic application for rapid hydrodefluorinative reduction in a single step to access complex \(N\)-methylated Fsp\(^3\)-enriched motif. This cost-effective strategy encompasses a full package of medicinally important functionalities (heterocycle, −NCF\(_2\)H, and imine/keto), making them highly valuable in the preparation of chemical libraries and effective drugs.

1. Introduction
Nitrogen heterocycles (\(N\)-heterocycles) are present in more than 85% of marketed and investigational drugs.\(^1\), \(^2\) Statistically, over the past few years, there has been an ever-increasing amount of \(N\)-heterocycles per prescribed medicine.\(^1\) Notably, both five- and six-membered \(N\)-heterocycles are especially valued for their prevalence among the best-selling clinically approved drugs worldwide to date (Figure 1A).\(^1\), \(^3\) These facts highlight the critical
role of $N$-heterocycles in pharmacological function.\textsuperscript{1, 3} Simultaneously, the introduction of fluorine atoms into $N$-heterocyclic substrates represents a powerful tool in biological research to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of structurally complex pharmaceutical molecules.\textsuperscript{4-8} Undoubtedly, the combination of these two ($N$-heterocycles + Fluoro substitution) distinctive different physicochemical properties is immensely occurring in new chemical entities (NCEs) with diverse biological functions, as exemplified by the expeditious construction of fluorinated motifs onto $N$-heterocyclic frameworks among the FDA-approved drug molecules.\textsuperscript{9, 10}

Complex $N$-heterocycles bearing the difluoromethyl moiety (Het−$N$CF$_2$H) have always been attractive in the isostere-based drug design and development (Figure 1C).\textsuperscript{11-15} Also, the −$N$CF$_2$H unit markedly influences lipophilicity, cellular membrane permeability, and conformational preferences (Figure 1D).\textsuperscript{11, 16-18} While $N$-difluoromethylated products hold great promise as therapeutic targets, there is a scarcity of preparative methods. Consequently, designing robust protocols for both practical applications and fundamental research has become critically important. Historically, $N$-difluoromethylated compounds were produced by the insertion of a difluorocarbene into the $N$-H bond of $N$-heterocycles using various difluoromethylating agents.\textsuperscript{11, 13} Generally, chlorodifluoromethane (Freon 22) is used as a key reagent to produce various −$N$CF$_2$H motifs.\textsuperscript{13} Sometimes, bromo- and iododifluoromethane are also employed for the incorporation of CF$_2$ carbene on $N$-heterocycles.\textsuperscript{13} However, such gaseous Freons are always avoided in the pharma industry, limiting the practical application of this reagent. Alternatively, other difluorocarbene precursors (e.g., ClCF$_2$CO$_2$Na, BrCF$_2$CO$_2$Et, TMSCF$_2$Br, TMSCF$_3$, etc.) have been developed. However, they are less pertinent in advancing $N$-difluoromethylation strategies.\textsuperscript{13} Further, depending on the type of $N$-heteroarene, difluoromethylation reagent, and reaction conditions, this method could provide exclusively either −$N$CF$_2$H compounds and/or $N$-difluoromethyl-2-pyridones (Figure 1E).\textsuperscript{19-29} Nevertheless, these approaches are restricted to simple $N$-heterocycles and have a quite narrow scope, as well as not applicable to late-stage $N$-difluoromethylation with commercial drugs, despite the potential for broad application in modern drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. Late-stage functionalization (LSF) is a powerful tool and plays a vital role in advancing the drug optimization process.\textsuperscript{30} In fact, LSF in organofluorine chemistry is considered the most versatile for rapid modification of existing bioactive compounds to produce a wide range of new congeners that were previously unanticipated with potential significance in the pharmaceutical process.\textsuperscript{31} Considering this, the search for environmentally responsible, safer, and more reliable late-stage $N$-difluoromethylation of structurally complex molecules (e.g., commercial drugs) exhibiting advanced functionalities with low-cost fluorinating agents under metal-free and ambient conditions remains a challenging but rewarding task.

Moreover, quinolin-4(1\textit{H})-Imines are gaining prominence in clinical research and development (Figure 1B).\textsuperscript{32, 33} It is generally accepted that the introduction of the difluoromethylene group into organic molecules can lead to impressive increases in the pharmacodynamic activity of drug candidates.\textsuperscript{16, 34} Consequently, every year, a large number
of diversified fluoro-pharmaceuticals often appear in the marketed drugs. Given the vital importance of these advantages, the incorporation of the CF₂H motif into such N-heterocycles represents a highly attractive approach, as these site-specific fluorinated compounds serve as medicinally relevant scaffolds to quickly diversify molecular fragments. In addition, quinolone derivatives are highly attractive in core pharmaceuticals such as Ivacaftor, Nalidixic acid, Ciprofloxacin, and many more (these drugs contain N-H/R) (Figure 1B). The replacement of the CF₂H group with an N-alkyl fragment or N-H bond in such drugs would play an essential role in drug repositioning. However, efforts to prepare the aforementioned structurally complex variants of the pharmaceutically privileged Het−NCF₂H compounds featuring either imine or ketone functional groups remain an underdeveloped goal in organofluorine chemistry, presumably due to the lack of synthetic methodologies.

Based on our continuous interest in organofluorine methodologies and owing to the excellent nucleophilicity of the nitrogen atom in N-heterocycles, we hypothesized that difluoromethyl species could selectively difluoromethylate the nitrogen atom in the heterocycle (Figure 1F). Once the activated heteroarenium salt is generated, it increases the acidity of the hydrogen atom in the external N-H bond of N-heterocycles. Next, deprotonation and π electron transfer from the external nitrogen atom of amine to the nitrogen atom of the heteroarene enables the unprecedented N-difluoromethylative dearomatized product (Figure 1F). According to this concept, we sought to investigate the reactivity of bromo(difluoro)acetic acid (commercially available, a benchtop stable and inexpensive solid) and introduce a new platform for the preparation of previously unexplored N-difluoromethylated compounds with the concurrent formation of a new imine or ketone moiety (Figure 1G), which is unusual compared to classical and/or already reported methods. Overall, this unique methodology was transition metal-free, safe, practical, scalable (>50 grams), tolerant to numerous reactive functional groups with excellent chemoselectivity, adaptable for important N-heterocyclic systems, and could be used for the late-stage diversification of 18 commercial drug molecules. Exceptionally, the synthesized products in this work encompass a comprehensive package of medicinally important functionalities (quinoline, −NCF₂H, and imine/keto), making it immediately applicable in the preparation of chemical libraries and innovative pharmaceuticals.

2. Results and Discussion

Since Het–NCF₂H motifs are prevalent in pharmaceutical settings and plant-based products,11–14 our goal was to design the reaction with readily available and inexpensive reagents, possibly under ambient and metal-free conditions. As briefly exemplified in Figure 2, we evaluated various difluoromethylation reagents (Figure 2A) for the difluoromethylation of the hydrochloride salt form of N-(3-fluoro-4-morpholinophenyl)quinolin-4-amine (1a) as a model compound (validated the chemical structure of 1a with Single crystal X-ray diffraction (ScXRD) (CCDC: 2410081). Among the employed difluoromethylation reagents, ethyl bromodifluoroacetate (2a) (1.2 equiv.) gave (E)-1-(difluoromethyl)-N-(3-fluoro-4-morpholinophenyl)quinolin-4(1H)-imine (3a) in 55% isolated yield using 2.5 equivalents of K₂CO₃ and DMF (2 ml) at room temperature for 18 h (3a is validated with ScXRD, CCDC: 2413933). Under the same conditions, only an appreciable yield of 3a was achieved with chlorodifluoroacetic acid (2b) and diethyl (bromodifluoroacetyl)phosphonate (2c). The reaction was unsuccessful with the TMS-CF₂Br reagent (2d). To our delight, the desired product 3a was obtained in 92% isolated yield with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid (2e) as a CF₂H reagent. In general, the synthetic utility of difluoromethylation methods in pharmaceutical manufacturing relies on the cost and commercial accessibility of difluoromethylation reagents, including simplified experimental settings. Compared to the price of other CF₂H reagents (see ESI, Table S1), bromo(difluoro)acetic acid is inexpensive, available in large quantities, and easy to handle even on a large scale, thereby improving cost efficiencies. Although this reagent (2e) has been known for a while in constructing a few fluorinated molecules,38–43 the ability to demonstrate N-difluoromethylation with complex N-heterocycles remains underexplored. Next, we screened the concentration of (2e) and observed that a minimum of 1.2 equiv. was required for an excellent yield of 3a (Figure 2B). Encouraged by the above-mentioned results, we continued our investigation with 2.5 equiv. of various bases and discovered that K₂CO₃ (92% of 3a) and Cs₂CO₃ (88% of 3a) are best among other bases, such as Na₂CO₃, KOH, and NaOH (27–79% of 3a) (Figure 2C). Considering the cost-effectiveness of the reaction, we proceeded the further optimization experiments with K₂CO₃ (B1). Further, we evaluated the concentration of K₂CO₃ and concluded that 2.5 equiv. is necessary for achieving a high yield of 3a (Figure 2D). We also carried out the reaction by using solvents such as DMSO, H₂O, EtOH, THF, and DMF (Figure 2E). The best yield of 3a (92%) was obtained in DMF as a solvent, and other solvents yielded inferior results (15–49% of 3a). Upon screening the reaction time, we found that 18 h is optimal to achieve 3a in high yield (Figure 2F). We also adapted the EcoScale tool and calculated the value for the conversion of 1a to 3a, and the results have shown that this protocol is safe and economically viable (see the ESI, 7. EcoScale calculations).

With viable reaction conditions in hand for the difluoromethylation of N-heterocycles, the study was advanced with a full exploration of structural scope compatibility, and results were summarized in Figure 3. Various N-Phenylquinolin-4-amine compounds derived from medicinally relevant structural moieties were effectively difluoromethylated in high to
excellent yields. The high functional group tolerance of C-X bonds (X = halogen) of N-phenylquinolin-4-amine is a valuable asset in all areas of preparative chemistry, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. Pleasingly, the reaction worked well with a range of halide-substituted N-phenylquinolin-4-amine, giving the desired difluoromethylated products 3b–3h in high yields. Interestingly, no dehalogenation of the C-X bond or byproduct took place. Next, sulfur-containing compounds can be found in a broad range of drugs owing to their different biological activities. Specifically, -SCF₃ and -SF₅ are fascinating functional groups with significant potential in modern drug development. Bearing this in mind, a wide set of sulfur-based building blocks was demonstrated here with our optimized conditions.

For instance, N-phenylquinolin-4-amine comprising -SCF₃, -SF₅, -SCH₃, and diphenyl sulfide, including sulfonamide, were well accommodated in this protocol and delivered the respective N-difluoromethylated products in very good yields (3i–3p), highlighting the remarkable sulfur resistance of this method. Unlike conventional strategies, our reaction conditions were amenable to double N-difluoromethylation featuring the imine unit, giving 3q in 89% yield without eroding the diphenyl sulfide group. We also evaluated 2-methyl-N-phenylquinolin-4-amine, delivering the expected product (3r) in very good yield, and the chemical structure was unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray crystallography (3r is validated with ScXRD, CCDC: 2410062). The reaction demonstrated good tolerance to the ether functional group and afforded the desired products in excellent yields (3s and 3t). The tolerance towards the alkene functional group (3u) is especially significant, as it provides opportunities for hydrofunctionalization and coupling reactions. Under optimal conditions, important crucial molecular skeletons, such as morpholine and piperazine-containing drug fragments, were also proved compatible, delivering the desired products efficiently in high yields (3v-3aa). Azo compounds have been found to be promising candidates as drug carriers due to their versatile biological activities, but the survival of such a valuable functional group is very scarce. Interestingly, N-phenylquinolin-4-amine derivatives bearing azo moiety were successfully N-difluoromethylated in very good yields with this cost-effective approach (3ab-3ac). Additionally, our protocol also accommodated biologically relevant heterocycles and was readily converted to N-difluoromethylated products in a very selective manner (3ad-3ag). Additionally, it was noteworthy that N-pyridyl-substituted aniline could proceed well and provide the corresponding 1-(difluoromethyl)-N-phenylpyridin-2(1H)-imine in 87% yield (3ah). N-(pyridin-2-yl)pivalamide and tert-butyl (3-methylpyridin-2-yl)carbamate are valuable pyridine-based molecular frameworks, undergo the selective N-difluoromethylation in 95% and 93% yield, respectively (3ai and 3aj). The malaria treatment drug, amodiaquine, was successfully N-difluoromethylated to access compound 3ak in 79% isolated yield. Neratinib, a protein kinase inhibitor used to treat breast cancer, was also N-difluoromethylated, albeit in 14% yield (3al) owing to less conversion. Further, amsacrine hydrochloride (m-AMSA hydrochloride, an anticancer agent) can be directly difluoromethylated to give 3am in 60% yield with this simple procedure. In addition, difluoromethylation of Piroxicam (CP-16171), a pain relief drug, under standard conditions gave a mixture of corresponding N-
and O-difluoromethylated products (3an + 3an’) in a ratio of 1:0.6 (determined by \textsuperscript{1}H NMR), which were found to be nonseparable with column chromatography. However, crystallization of the nonseparable mixture (3an + 3an’) gave yellow crystals of the major N-difluoromethylated isomer (validated the chemical structure of 3an with ScXRD, CCDC: 2410066), and the minor isomer 3an’ did not result in any crystallization. Acalabrutinib, useful for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in adults,\textsuperscript{50} was successfully converted into the desired product 3ao in a 41\% isolated yield at 24 h of reaction time.

Quinazolinamine derivatives are the common molecular frameworks in biologically active compounds. Several top-selling commercial drugs, such as gefitinib, erlotinib, osimertinib, and many more, comprise quinazoline core and are considered as a “privileged structure” in drug design. Since quinazolines have two nitrogen atoms, we sought to utilize one of them suitably for N-difluoromethylation in order to enhance their biological profiles. In this vein, commercially available drugs such as Erlotinib (used to treat non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer) and FAAH-IN-2 (O-Desmorpholinopropyl Gefitinib), a metabolite of Gefitinib underwent the current difluoromethylation process smoothly and afforded corresponding products in synthetically useful yields (Figure 4, 5a-5b). The exceptional tolerance of alkyne and halide functionality in these drugs provides a useful route for further diversification of medicinally relevant molecules. Surprisingly, 2,5-dichloro-N-(2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrimidin-4-amine, a synthetic intermediate of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, gave somewhat unexpected product 5-chloro-1-(difluoromethyl)-4-((2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)amino)pyrimidin-2(1H)-one (5c) under routine conditions. To get some insight into this unusual behavior, a crystal structure of 5c (CCDC: 2413970) was obtained, and it revealed the presence of a strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the H-atom of the free N-H bond and the O-atom of the SO₂ functional group. We believe this could be a possible reason for the decrease in the acidity of the H-atom of the N-H bond, which restricts deprotonation. The nucleophilic addition of water on the ortho site of the pyrimidine ring (Ipso to the Cl atom), followed by the substitution of the chloride atom, leads to the formation of a stabilized N-difluoromethylated product 5c. Most importantly, Kinetin, a plant hormone that regulates cell growth in plants, could also provide double difluoromethylated product (5d) in 81% isolated yield (validated the chemical structure of 5d with ScXRD, CCDC: 2410069). 2-((6-chloro-2-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-N-(2-chloro-6-methylphenyl)thiazole-5-carboxamide, a key intermediate of dasatinib drug, gave 61% isolated yield of a mixture of 5e and 5e’ (ratio of 5e and 5e’ is 1:0.9; determined by 19F NMR). To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of such novel N-difluoromethylated products holding imine functional groups is completely unknown.
Next, under the same conditions, we surveyed the scope of the reaction with pyridin-4-ol and quinolin-4-ol derivatives with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid (Figure 5). Since functionalized pyridines are considered attractive scaffolds and found in many bioactive compounds,1, 2 site-selective installation of the −CF₂H group onto nitrogen atoms would create a valuable platform for the preparation of an array of \(N\)-difluoromethylated products. Unsubstituted 4-hydroxy pyridine, 3-methyl pyridin-4-ol, and halogen-substituted 4-hydroxy pyridines underwent the selective \(N\)-difluoromethylation with simultaneous formation of ketone functional group in good to excellent yields (7a-7e), underscores that chloride and iodo substituents are also tolerated by the reaction conditions. Gratifyingly, challenging pyridine derivatives such as (\(E\))-3-(4-fluorostyryl)pyridin-4-ol and (\(E\))-3-(4-(trifluoromethyl)styryl)pyridin-4-ol, also reacted smoothly to afford the corresponding difluoromethylated products 7f and 7g, with isolated yields of 76% and 78%, respectively.

Quinolones and their derivatives play a fundamental role as the pharmacophore for several drug molecules.5 In this vein, we sought to apply our reaction conditions to enhance their clinical development. A variety of 4-hydroxyquinolines with halide-substituents and electron-donating groups worked well under optimal conditions, delivering the
corresponding $N$-difluoromethylated products in high yields ($7h$-$7n$). Interestingly, difluoromethylation of two hydroxy groups containing 1,10-phenanthroline-4,7-diol selectively underwent both $N$- and $O$-difluoromethylation within the molecule and gave the respective product $7o$ in 89% isolated yield, displaying the potential double difluoromethylation of the present method. The fused heterocyclic compound containing both triazole and pyrimidine rings, such as 5-Methyl-2-(methylthio)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-ol found in biologically active compounds also reacted efficiently to give $7p$ in high yield. Additionally, 4-quinolone of several therapeutic compounds proceeded smoothly to provide targeted difluoromethylated products $7q$-$7s$ (74-78% yield). When conducting experiments with quinolin-4-ol and quinolone derivatives, minor amounts of $O$-difluoromethylated products were also detected. For confirmation, we have isolated $O$-difluoromethylated products (22% yield of $7n'$) of $6n$ and analysed them with NMR and HRMS. Next, we assessed this protocol for the late-stage functionalization of the quinolone-based drug. For instance, Ivacaftor (listed 13th in the top-200-selling drugs in 2023), which is used to treat cystic fibrosis, could be selectively $N$-difluoromethylated in 64% isolated yield ($7t$), thus demonstrating the advantages of this simple operational approach. In addition, we also investigated the influence of the steric effect and subjected the unseen examples of $6u$ and $6v$ to difluoromethylation under standard conditions. As a result, difluoromethylation of $6u$ (carboxylate moiety is neighbor to C=O) favored selective $N$-difluoromethylated product ($7u$) in 81% yield. Whereas difluoromethylation of $6v$ (carboxylate moiety is neighbor to N-H) favored selective $O$-difluoromethylated product ($7v$) in 78% yield (Figure 5). These results clearly suggest that steric hindrance governs the selective $O$- and $N$-difluoromethylation in these reactions.

Encouraged by the above results, we became interested in late-stage N-difluoromethylation with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid in a straightforward manner (Figure 6A). Notably, four APIs, Azathioprine, Aprovel, Lansoprazole, and Mercaptopurine, were selectively N-difluoromethylated under standard conditions to give products 9a-9d, signifying tolerance of key functional groups in more complex settings. Azathioprine, which contains a purine ring and is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, gave the corresponding product 9a (verified the chemical structure of 9a with ScXRD, CCDC: 2410064) in 71% isolated yield. Another drug molecule, Aprovel, bearing tetrazole ring system, is used to treat high blood pressure, also underwent N-difluoromethylation to afford the product 9b (verified the chemical structure 9b with ScXRD, CCDC: 2410078) in synthetically useful yield. Lansoprazole (used to treat stomach ulcers) also delivered corresponding N-difluoromethylated product 9c in 72% isolated yield. Furthermore, Mercaptopurine, a chemotherapy drug, was also feasible for double N-difluoromethylation and afforded 9d.
even in a higher yield (78%). These results underscore the functional group tolerance and the generality of this N-difluoromethylation procedure.

Based on these results, we next assessed the scope of the difluoromethylation of biologically active lactams under optimal conditions at room temperature (Figure 6B). First, the commercially available Sildenafil Lactam, used to treat erectile dysfunction, was applied for difluoromethylation. However, surprisingly O-difluoromethylated product is obtained in 72% isolated yield (11a). Similarly, Triacetyl-ganciclovir, an orally active antiviral agent, also delivered an O-difluoromethylated product with a 61% yield (11b). Also, the Brexpiprazole intermediate (an antipsychotic drug) and a simple pyridinone system gave O-difluoromethylated products in 73% and 91% yield, respectively (11c and 11d). It is well known that in the presence of a polar aprotic solvent, either at room temperature or higher temperature, the lactam form becomes a more stable form from its tautomeric lactim form owing to its extra stabilization through resonance. Gratifyingly, our reaction conditions (DMF as a polar aprotic solvent at room temperature) are completely in favor of lactam form, in which nucleophilicity and localization of lone pair of electrons on the O-atom are higher as compared to the N-atom. We believe this could be a probable reason for selective O-difluoromethylation instead of N-difluoromethylation with lactams. All these products (11a-11d) are isolated for the first time to furnish novel medicinally relevant O-CF₂H motifs. Overall, this approach provides a simple and straightforward route for drug discovery applications.

Scaling up the production of fluorinated compounds poses a significant challenge in medicinal chemistry because of the costs associated with fluorinating reagents, specialized equipment, safety standards, and maintaining precise reaction conditions. By keeping this in mind and to demonstrate the synthetic utility of our simplified protocol, we conducted the difluoromethylation with \(N\)-(3-fluoro-4-morpholinophenyl)quinolin-4-amine (1a) on the 142-mmol scale (>50 gram) and achieved the desired product (E)-1-(difluoromethyl)-\(N\)-(3-fluoro-4-morpholinophenyl)quinolin-4(1H)-imine (3a) in 89% isolated yield (for experimental set-up and reaction procedure, see ESI, Figure S12), and the performance of this scale-up is virtually identical with 0.5 mmol-scale of the reaction, displaying the easiness of the method (Figure 7A).

Hydrodefluorination is a process that converts a C-F bond to a C-H bond, which is significant in creating novel therapeutic agents.\(^{6,7}\) By keeping this in mind, we sought to
showcase the synthetic potential of imine-based N-difluoromethylated products using the hydrodefluorination approach. In this vein, we mixed 3a, NaBH₄, and Al₂O₃ (all are solid reagents) and grinded with hand in a Mortar-pestle by slowly adding 30 drops of methanol (3 drops per minute). These conditions led to a valuable 3D shape N-methylated motif 21 in 47% isolated yield (Figure 7B), and this result underscores that our proposed synthetic strategy provides versatile access to high Fsp³-enriched scaffolds, which holds the promise of drug discovery in medicinal chemistry purposes. It should be noted that rapid synthesis of compound 21 with high Fsp³ is difficult to access using conventional strategies.

To gain insight into how the N-difluoromethylation reaction works, we conducted a few control experiments. Initially, we executed a deuterium labelling experiment with 1a using D₂O (10 equiv.) under standard conditions. This experiment resulted in an 86% isolated yield of the desired deuterated product (d-3a) with 74% deuterium incorporation (Figure 8A). Next, we treated d-3a with H₂O (10 equiv.) under the same conditions in the absence of 2e, and the result showed that there was no exchange of H-D; and d-3a was recovered with 79% isolated yield (Figure 8B), showcasing the stability of d-3a. Further, to identify the source of the H atom in the CF₂-H unit of 3a, we carried out the reaction of d-1a (34%-D incorporation; for the preparation of d-1a, see ESI, Figure S8-S9) with 2e under standard conditions, but no deuterium incorporation was observed, and 3a was isolated with 89% yield (0%-D incorporation) (Figure 8C). This finding clearly validates that the hydrogen atom of the CF₂-H unit in 3a is not a part of the N-H component of 1a. This implies that BrCF₂CO₂H could be a source of the H atom in the CF₂H unit of 3a, which is corroborated by the literature.²⁸ To know the reaction intermediate, we first treated 1a with 2e under standard conditions without adding K₂CO₃. The analysis of the crude reaction mixture by HRMS revealed the formation of intermediate 3a', while the desired product 3a was not detected. Later, the addition of K₂CO₃ (2.5 equiv.) in the same reaction mixture resulted in the formation of 3a, evidencing the requirement of K₂CO₃ for transforming 3a' to 3a.
Based on the results obtained from our control experiments and literature precedents, we proposed a probable reaction mechanism (Figure 8E). Although, 2e is known to generate a CF$_2$ carbene precursor in a basic medium, but surprisingly the formation of intermediate 3a' without a base directed the first step of the reaction to be a simple nucleophilic substitution reaction between the starting material (12) and 2e. The more nucleophilicity of the N-atom of N-heteroarene (12) and a rapid release of CO$_2$ gas via decarboxylation resulted formation of intermediate 13. It is presumed that the formation of intermediate 13 renders the N-H bond dissociation energy via increasing the acidity of the H-atom attached to the N-H bond, which could be probably due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the N-heteroarene (intermediate 13). Finally, K$_2$CO$_3$ abstracts the acidic proton from the N-H bond and generates another intermediate 14, which further undergoes π electron transfer to deliver the highly stabilized N-difluoromethylated product featuring an imine (15) functional group (Figure 8E). Importantly, our methodology was found to be highly efficient and suitable for N-aromatic substituted heteroarene-4-amines. For instance, when N-methylpyridin-4-amine (16a) and chloroquine (16b) were applied to the difluoromethylation under standard conditions, only a trace amount of corresponding products 17a, and 17b, respectively, was detected (analysed by $^{19}$F NMR). Whereas amodiaquine (1ak) was successfully transformed into imine-based N-difluoromethylated product 3ak. This protocol has some limitations with 4-methyl pyridine systems (18a) which may be due to less acidity of the H-atom of C(sp$^3$)-H bond.

3. Conclusions

In summary, the first efficient access to Het−NCF$_2$H complex products featuring either imine and/or ketone moieties was unlocked herein. The methodology utilizes inexpensive, commercially available, and bench-stable bromo(difluoro)acetic acid as a difluoromethylating agent with K$_2$CO$_3$ as a base. Depending on the type of nitrogen heterocycle, this approach also permits the incorporation of two CF$_2$H units. The key to accomplishing the aforementioned products is the increased nucleophilicity and reduced steric hindrance on the nitrogen atom of the heteroarene ring. The ambient reaction conditions and high chemoselectivity have permitted the difluoromethylation of >70 privileged N-heterocyclic substrates (e.g., derivatives of quinolines, quinazolines, pyridines, lactams, etc.), including 18 commercial drugs. In addition, this streamlined approach can run up to a 142-mmol scale (>50 g) with exceptional inclusion of the CF$_2$H group in 1a comprising the imine unit. Mechanistic investigations concluded that N-difluoromethylquinolinium salt serves as a key intermediate for the decarboxylative N-
difluoromethylation with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid. In the end, for the first time, we have successfully proven the rapid hydrodefluorinative reduction in a single step, utilizing it to construct a complex \(N\)-methylated Fsp\(^3\)-enriched scaffold. We anticipate this comprehensive cost-effective strategy significantly expands the drug-like chemical space accessible to small-molecule \(N\)-difluoromethylated compounds.
