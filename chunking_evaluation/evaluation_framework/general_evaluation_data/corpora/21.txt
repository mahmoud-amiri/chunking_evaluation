Abstract:

Targeted phase engineering of nanomaterials through non-equilibrium synthesis strategies provides a rich platform for the development and tuning of nanostructured catalysts with outstanding properties and life-time. Unconventional phases or even complex heterostructures play a crucial role in the performance of catalysts for efficient water electrolysis. By utilizing a controlled, iterative reduction synthesis route, a tailored binder-free cobalt boride-phosphite electrode (CoₓB-[0.2]P-O) with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases is developed. The tailored cobalt chemistry, hierarchical morphology and mixed phases synergistically enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Those electrodes exhibit platinum-like HER performance with an overpotential of 33 mV at the standard current density of 10 mA cm⁻², with excellent intrinsic kinetics and enhanced electron transfer in an alkaline 1M KOH electrolyte. Comprehensive microstructure and spectroscopic analyses proved the success of the one-pot strategy to modulate the chemistry of cobalt by incorporating boron and phosphite. Moreover, the tailored formation of nanostructures with locally varying morphology by the co-existence of amorphous and crystalline phases on the nanometer scale is confirmed. This approach facilitates the rational design for tuning the metal boride-based catalysts’ activity for hydrogen evolution by tailored chemistry of the metal active centers and thus the phase engineering of similar nanomaterials while avoiding the necessity of any post-synthesis thermal treatment processes.

1. Introduction

Electrochemical energy technologies will significantly contribute to the transition to a sustainable and carbon-neutral economy in order to decarbonize the energy sector.\(^1\) One of the most critical scientific and technological problems is the development of a sustainable and cost-effective water splitting processes for industrial-scale production of green H\(_2\) to facilitate the energy transition.\(^2\) Heterogeneous catalysis is a key element of the solution.\(^3\) Benchmark electrocatalysts with a zero HER overpotential used in low temperature water electrolysis systems are, however, based on scarce, expensive noble metals (specifically platinum group metal (PGM) catalysts).\(^4\) This makes them economically less attractive and does not meet the requirements for the global demand of green H\(_2\). Consequently, the development of low-cost, stable, and highly efficient hydrogen-evolving materials is of key importance to meet this demand. Earth-abundant transition metal (TM)-based materials have attracted much attention as alternative electrocatalysts, especially in alkaline electrolytes.\(^5\) However, chemical modulation strategies of catalysts and economically viable synthesis routes to generate nanostructured materials with durable and enhanced catalytic performances are still required especially for the green hydrogen production, especially at an industrial scale.\(^4, 6\)

A major process bottleneck, when operating in alkaline media, is the reduced kinetics due to the water-dissociation energy barrier.\(^7\) However, alkaline water electrolysis allows the utilization of TM-based materials, which serve as PGM-free alternatives with better HER kinetics.\(^8\) Emerging technologies such as anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis, for industrial scale water splitting, require electrocatalysts that are capable to even operate under mild alkaline conditions (less or equal to 1M KOH) or pure water.\(^9\) To enhance the kinetics of the reduction reaction, the chemical environment of TM-based catalysts can be tailored by incorporating nonmetals and metalloid elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, nitrogen, selenium, and boron.\(^10\) Engineering of the material’s morphology, crystal structure, and catalyst support are leveraged to improve extrinsic catalytic activity of complete electrodes.\(^3\)

A careful choice of the substrate material and the design of the substrate/catalyst interface especially for highly conductive substrates is also important.\(^11\) This enables strong adhesion and enhanced charge transfer due to extended exposure of more catalytic active sites to adsorbates promoting the HER activity and life-cycle of the electrocatalysts.\(^12\) By combining the above strategies, earth-abundant transition metal-based catalysts are developed with high activity comparable to precious metal-based catalysts.
The TM-based borides and boron oxides, which are abundant and provide economically attractive alternatives, showed promising catalytic performance for water splitting.\cite{13} Central to this class of materials is cobalt boride with moderate HER activity.\cite{14} Cobalt boride (Co₅B)-based materials take advantage of the fact that Co as first-row transition metal possesses three unoccupied d-orbitals facilitating facile surface chemical interactions.\cite{15} Metalloids such as boron and phosphorus have been known to influence the electronic configuration of the metal sites.\cite{16} Electron-deficient borides have been employed to shift electrons towards the vacant d-orbitals of the active Co sites,\cite{17} to beneficially affect the electron transfer between the reactant and the catalyst, and further to increase the reduction reaction kinetics.\cite{10, 18} In amorphous Co₅B-based materials reverse electron transfer shifts electron density from B to Co thereby creating electron-rich Co sites which enhances Co interactions with protons leading to enhanced HER.\cite{13a, 19} Incorporation of phosphorous into a Co₅B system directly modulates the electron density around cobalt atoms, which impacts electron transfer and the hydrogen interaction with the active sites.\cite{20} Despite the considerable progress made in the development of efficient cobalt boride-based electrocatalysts, advanced synthesis strategies affording the tailored cobalt chemistry, modulation of the electronic nature of cobalt and advanced phase engineering at the nanoscale for HER are crucial.\cite{21}

Besides the careful choice of a performant material system, the global and, more importantly, local crystal structure of the chosen system plays a significant role in determining its catalytic performance.\cite{22} Amorphous systems inherently possess dangling bonds randomly oriented in space, which results in a higher degree of unsaturated electronic configurations.\cite{23} Consequently, purely amorphous catalysts possess a large fraction of unsaturated active sites facilitating efficient adsorption and surface reactions at the cost of conductivity.\cite{22-23} In contrast, crystalline phases enhance the material’s intrinsic conductivity.\cite{22, 24} It is therefore necessary to produce catalysts, which take advantage of the synergistic effect of complex heterostructures consisting of crystalline and amorphous phases at the nanoscale.\cite{21-22, 25} TM-boride catalysts are typically synthesized via chemical reduction reactions of transition metal cations in aqueous solution using alkali metal tetrahydrides as reducing agent and a boron source to precipitate metal-borides.\cite{17c, 26} However, this reaction is spontaneous and it is a challenge to control the final products. Such products are mostly amorphous,\cite{27} and typically require post-thermal treatment to induce some form of crystallinity or utilize highly conductive carbon to enhance the electrocatalytic performance.\cite{14, 28}
TM-boride-based nanomaterials, therefore, provide a suitable platform for phase engineering at the nanoscale to develop efficient HER electrocatalysts with unique chemistry, morphology, and unconventional mixed crystalline-amorphous phases using only a facile and cost-effective wet-chemical reduction process.\[29\]

Herein, we use an elaborate synthesis strategy to develop a series of self-supported, amorphous-crystalline (heterostructured), nanostructured cobalt boride phosphite electrocatalysts. Our synthesis technique avoids any additional energy-intensive annealing process as commonly employed to induce crystallinity in TM-boride based catalysts synthesized in an aqueous reducing solution. Moreover, it overcomes the use of binders, such as Nafion, to stabilize the catalyst, enabling improved mass transport, enhanced access to active sites, less interfacial resistance, and higher electrical conductivity without adding carbon nanomaterials. Degradation is minimized as the self-support on the utilized metal foam eliminates peeling of any powder catalyst during operation,\[30\] with the open-porous nickel foam (NF) facilitating efficient mass transport. Comprehensive electrochemical and structure characterization of Co$_x$B-O, reference Co(OH)$_2$ as well as the complex, highly performing Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O samples, revealed that the enhanced catalytic activity resulted from the unique heterostructure and synergistic effects of cobalt with boron and phosphite in the electrocatalyst structure.

2. Results and discussion

2.1 Fabrication and surface chemistry analysis of self-supported electrode

The electroless preparation of a series of self-supported heterostructured cobalt boride-based electrodes is schematically shown in Fig. 1 A-H (details in Fig. S1). Highly open-porous and hollow nickel foam (NF) (Fig. 1 G, H, Fig. S2 A) is used as substrate as it allows for excellent liquid/gas transport, is chemically stable, provides high electrical conductivity and a suited surface for the catalyst fabrication/operation.\[31\] X-ray micro-tomography (µCT) furthermore depicts the hollow nature and thus material-saving NF due to its thin walls of the foam struts (Fig. 1 H). The facile synthesis employs an iteratively controlled chemical reduction reaction of cobalt cations (solution A: Co(NO$_3$)$_2$·6H$_2$O) by mixtures of reducing agents in an aqueous solution (solution B: NaBH$_4$ and NaH$_2$PO$_3$·H$_2$O). Sodium borohydride acts as the strong reaction-controlling reducing agent, while sodium phosphite is a weaker reducing agent.
This combination of reducing agents facilitates, both, the inherent formation of Co₃B-O and immediate doping by phosphite, while at a later stage, the complex amorphous-crystalline Co₃B-[0.2]P-O catalyst is formed. The cobalt source, i.e. solution A, is first adsorbed on the NF substrate (Fig. S1) and subsequently immersed in the reducing solution B. This iterative process was repeated 5 times, whereby the cobalt ions are locally reduced on the surface.[32] As a result, a dense, nanocrystalline and well-adhering seed layer on the NF is generated (intermediate state depicted in Fig. 1 C, D, Fig. S3 A) to assure mechanical long-term stability during catalyst operation (Fig. S4), good electron transport and an enhanced surface area (cf. Fig. 1 B, D). In a second synthesis step the seed-layer coated NF substrate is immersed into solution A, while solution B was slowly added. In this reactive mixture, the final active catalyst is formed on the seed layer, which is indicated by the roughened surface in Fig. 1 F (cf. Fig. 1 D, Fig. S2 C, D, Fig. S3 B details in SI). SEM-EDX analysis demonstrated the presence of Co, B, P, and O, indicating the formation of CoₓB-[0.2]P-O (Fig. S5). Figure 1 further depicts Co(OH)₂ nanosheets as typically formed in NaBH₄-containing reduction reaction environments.[33] Particularly, the high energy impact of the rapid exothermic reaction on the roughened seed layer surface allows for the localized atomic-scale structural rearrangement and thus the formation of amorphous-crystalline heterostructured CoₓB-[0.2]P-O without any additional thermal treatment.

Surface-sensitive X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig.1 I-L), confirms the successful incorporation of the B and P species and their impact on the electronic environment of the Co active sites within the catalyst layer. XPS survey revealed a surface composition of 23.17 at.%, 29.71 at.%, 29.73 at.%, 5.02 at.%, and 12.37 at.% for B, C, O, P, and Co respectively (cf. Fig. S6). Deconvolution of the Co 2p₃/₂ spectrum clearly reveals the tailored Co-B interaction, resulting in a distinct sub-peak at 777.7 eV, which is 0.4 eV shifted to lower binding energy compared to metallic Co⁰ (778.1 eV [34]) due to the electron transfer from boron to cobalt (Fig. 1 I). [17a, 17b, 17c] In addition there are two major peaks of Co 2p₃/₂ at 781.6 eV and Co 2p₁/₂ at 797.4 eV, respectively, with a spin-orbit splitting of ΔE = 15.8 eV.
Detailed analysis of the Co 2p$_{3/2}$ peak reveals two contributions with typical shifts to higher binding energies (781.1 eV and 782.9 eV) owing to cobalt (II) cations bound to highly electronegative species such as hydroxides and phosphites, respectively.\textsuperscript{[14, 35]} The electron transfer between Co and B is further indicated by the positive 0.6 eV shift relative to B\textsuperscript{0} (187.1 eV) in the B 1s peak (187.7 eV), attributed to the boride species (Fig. 1 J).\textsuperscript{[17b, 28, 36]} Phosphite incorporation into the catalyst was evidenced by the deconvoluted P 2p spectrum (Fig. 1 K) into two major sub-peaks at 133.6 eV and 134 eV ($\Delta = 0.87$ eV) characteristic for the presence of phosphorous (III) species and an extra peak at higher energy for phosphorous (V) in oxidized P-O molecules.\textsuperscript{[37]} Like boron, the phosphorous inclusion into the Co-B system directly modulates the electron density around cobalt atoms, which impacts electron transfer and the hydrogen interaction with the active sites.\textsuperscript{[20]} The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 1 L) shows three sub-peaks at 531.5 eV, 532.5 eV, and 533.9 eV. The signals at 531.5 eV and 532.5 eV consistently reveals the presence of mixed metal-oxide/hydroxide (e.g. Co(OH)$_2$/ CoO) and the P/B-O (in oxidized P species and B-O in boron-oxo species), respectively.\textsuperscript{[38]}
2.2 Microstructural and chemical characterization

A comprehensive scale-bridging investigation of the microstructure, crystal structure and chemistry of the electrodes with emphasis on the active catalyst is indispensable to understand catalyst functionality, performance and long-term stability. The continuous coating of the NF surface is confirmed by SEM top-view and cross-sectional imaging (Fig. 1 F, G, Fig. 2 A, B) as corroborated by the Co mapping. The coating roughness (Fig. 2 B), governed by the seed layer with a mean grain size of the polycrystalline Co₈B-[0.2]P-O of around 100 nm (Fig. 1 D), enhances active surface area and thus promotes HER. The tailored two-step reduction reaction resulted in the formation of the targeted sequence of seed layer and active catalyst, with the latter exhibiting amorphous-crystalline morphology surpassing conventional reduction strategies with typical amorphous structure. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the continuous coverage of the crystalline Co₈B-[0.2]P-O seed layer (and partly tiny particles generated during the second coating step) by the amorphous-crystalline catalyst heterostructure (Fig. 2 C, D).
Figure 2 D details the morphology of the amorphous-crystalline CoₓB-[0.2]P-O at the catalyst surface with crystalline domains of around 10 nm embedded in the amorphous matrix. The nanocrystalline nature of the CoₓB-[0.2]P-O particles is reflected as severe peak broadening in XRD (Fig. S7).

The complex architecture of the developed electrocatalyst is further confirmed by three-dimensional (3D) tomographic reconstruction (Fig. S13). The reconstruction delineates the nanostructures showing agglomerated nanoparticles (seed layer) at the bottom of the electrode covered by porous nanosheets at the top exposing a large surface area. This hierarchical morphology is necessary for efficient mass transport during the catalytic reaction with the large surface area providing a high number of active sites for surface chemical reactions. [39]

Cross-sectional TEM samples, prepared by ultramicrotomy, enabled the detailed characterization of the local composition and bonding by STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, both, the seed layer and the active catalyst region are differentiated (Fig. 3 A, D, G). The dense Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O particles with active catalyst coating appear bright in the HAADF-STEM images in contrast to the faint nanosheets (Fig. 3 A, D). The systematic co-occurrence of B, Co and a minor concentration of O, as depicted in Fig. 3 B, E, H proves the successful formation of cobalt boride (Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O). In contrast, the nanosheets, (upper dataset) consist of Co, higher O concentration and reduced B concentration. Both, the Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O as well as the nanosheets are linked to specific Co species (cf. Fig. C, F, I, Fig. S11, Fig. S12). Owing the low local concentration and its unsuited shape of the ionization edge in conjunction with the challenging sample geometry, any P distribution could not be derived with the EELS technique (see experimental section). However, the homogeneous incorporation of P is proven by STEM X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S10) and XPS (Fig. 1 K, Fig. S6).

Furthermore, EELS allows for the separation of the Co oxidation state as particularly the L$_3$ intensity (in correlation to the L$_2$ intensity) directly correlates with the number of unoccupied 3d states and is thus a measure for the change in Co oxidation state. The seed-layer particles and active catalyst material show a higher, but mixed oxidation state of Co (Fig. 3 C, F, I) in comparison to the nanosheets. That higher mean oxidation state is not necessarily reflected in an increased L$_3$/L$_2$ ratio of the respective peak heights but in a significantly broader L$_3$ peak (and thus intensity).

Both, the L$_{3,2}$ peak maxima/onsets of the Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O (seed layer + active catalyst) are systematically shifted towards higher binding energies by approximately 1 eV compared to the hydroxide reference indicating partial electron transfer to highly electro-negative adjacent species like B and P. While the peak shape of the nanosheets is similar to that of the Co hydroxide reference with a periodic atomic arrangement, the significantly broadened Co L$_3$ peak of the catalyst indicates strong local variations of the composition and next-neighbor configuration (particularly B/P/O(H)) on the atomic scale and thus varying electronic environments of the active Co species.

This is indicative of a change in the ligand field of the active Co catalyst centers. The incorporation of B and P as phosphite creates a unique ligand environment around Co, which leverages the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating properties of both species.

While B may withdraw or donate (reverse electron transfer) electron density from Co, depending on whether the materials is crystalline or amorphous, P donates electron density...
resulting in a complementary interaction with a balanced electronic environment and tailored ligand field, thereby optimizing the overall ad/de-sorption of reactants and facilitating enhanced HER catalytic activity as reflected in the catalytic performance (Fig. 4).

2.3 Electrochemical Performance

The electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes for HER was studied in a common three-electrode cell containing 1.0 M KOH\textsubscript{(aq)} electrolyte. Graphite and mercury oxide/mercury (HgO/Hg) were used as counter current and reference electrodes respectively (details in SI: electrochemical evaluation section). The properties of the Co\textsubscript{x}B-[0.2]P-O as active catalyst coating were determined from comparative \(iR\)-corrected linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves. The LSV curve of Co\textsubscript{x}B-[0.2]P-O shows a significant shift toward lower potentials compared to that of both the NF substrate and even a commercial 20% Pt/C catalyst loaded on the NF (Fig. 4 A).

The enhanced catalytic performance of the self-supported Co\textsubscript{x}B-[0.2]P-O electrodes is characterized by a very low overpotential of 33 mV (Fig. 4 B, Fig. S14) at the standard geometric current density (\(\eta\)@ 10 mA cm\(^{-2}\)). It shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance compared to reported self-supported cobalt-based catalysts (e.g. cobalt-boride-phosphide\textsuperscript{[41]} cobalt phosphide spheres/cobalt hydroxide nanosheets\textsuperscript{[42]} cobalt phosphide\textsuperscript{[43]} cobalt boride\textsuperscript{[44]} cobalt hydroxide\textsuperscript{[45]} and cobalt pyrophosphate\textsuperscript{[46]} cobalt oxide\textsuperscript{[47]} and other cobalt catalysts\textsuperscript{[47-48]}) for HER in alkaline solution to achieve \(\eta\)@ = 10 mA cm\(^{-2}\) (Fig. 4 B). The control sample (Co(OH)\(_2\)) and the NF substrate required relatively similar values (208 mV for Co(OH)\(_2\) and 306 mV for NF at \(\eta\)@ = 10 mA cm\(^{-2}\)) as previously reported ones of 228 mV\textsuperscript{[42]} and 182 mV\textsuperscript{[45]} for Co(OH)\(_2\), and 252 mV for NF\textsuperscript{[41]} respectively (Table S1).
Figure 4: Electrocatalytic performance of catalysts for HER: A) LSV curves for as-fabricated catalysts Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O, Co$_x$B-O, Co(OH)$_2$, commercial Pt/C, and bare NF in 1.0 M KOH, B) comparison of overpotentials of as-prepared Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O, Co$_x$B-O electrocatalysts, and NF to cobalt-based catalysts in alkaline electrolyte solution, C) Tafel slopes and D) EIS Nyquist plots of Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O, Co$_x$B-O, Co(OH)$_2$, commercial Pt/C, and bare NF; insets show the equivalent circuit used for fitting the data and overall Nyquist plot as overview, E) bar graph of the turnover frequency (TOF), F) double-layer capacitance.

The mechanism of HER in an alkaline solution involves an additional step of breaking water molecules to generate protons.$^{[49]}$ This process, therefore, requires extra energy for successful water splitting and causes more sluggish reaction kinetics.$^{[50]}$ This is depicted by the Tafel value for the optimized Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O which was observed to be the lowest among the investigated sample series at 49 mV dec$^{-1}$, which is competitive to Pt/C (35 mV dec$^{-1}$) (Fig. 4 C). Such a low value infers an enhanced electron-coupled water dissociation step, known to be the rate-determining step for HER in alkaline conditions.$^{[14]}$ This demonstrates that our boron and phosphite-incorporated catalyst (Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O) has more efficient HER reaction kinetics relative to Co(OH)$_2$ and Co$_x$B-O counterparts.
These enhanced reaction kinetics are corroborated by detailed analyses of Nyquist plots retrieved from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements (Fig. 4 D). The charge transfer resistance \( (R_c) \) values, determined from the radii of the Nyquist plots, were 4.1 \( \Omega \), 17.6 \( \Omega \), and 69.4 \( \Omega \) for Co\(_x\)B-[0.2]P-O, Co\(_x\)B-O (control catalyst), and Co(OH)\(_2\) (control catalyst), respectively. Evidently, the optimized boron and phosphite-doped catalyst has a reduced \( R_c \) value compared to the counter and control electrocatalysts.

This comparison proves a better adsorption-desorption efficiency of the reactants due to better charge transfer by the reduced binding energy due to the P co-doping.\(^{[16]}\) The control catalyst Co(OH)\(_2\) exhibits the highest \( R_c \) value most likely since this material did not include cobalt-boride or phosphite in the structure. The electronic configuration of cobalt determined by XPS analysis showed that the presence of both B and P of phosphite ensured the tailored chemistry of Co through charge transfer processes, and as a consequence the observed better charge transfer in Co\(_x\)B-[0.2]P-O. Among the series of catalysts, only the Co(OH)\(_2\) control catalyst exhibits a purely crystalline form (Fig. S8 and Fig. S9), whereas both, Co\(_x\)B-[0.2]P-O and Co\(_x\)B-O, show mixed amorphous-crystalline heterostructures. We therefore conclude that the chemistry (boron and phosphite incorporation) as well as the co-existence of mixed phases cause the synergistic enhancement of the electron transfer process.

The Co\(_x\)B-[0.2]P-O electrocatalyst exhibits by far the highest hydrogen production per active site as demonstrated by a superior TOF value of 0.87 s\(^{-1}\) at a voltage of -0.05 V vs. RHE, which is approximately 15 times higher than that of the counter catalyst (Co\(_x\)B-O) (Fig. 4 E, Fig. S15). As anticipated from the hierarchical, and rough morphology of the catalyst surface, these electrocatalysts showed relatively similar electrocatalytic surface area (ECSA) which correlates to the double layer capacitance \( (C_{dl}) \) values of Co\(_x\)B-[0.2]P-O (3.5 mF cm\(^{-2}\)), Co\(_x\)B-O (3.1 mF cm\(^{-2}\)) and Co(OH)\(_2\) (2.6 mF cm\(^{-2}\)) (Fig. 4 F, Fig. S16). While the ECSA values of the three materials are similar, the TOF measurements provide evidence that the local chemistry of the active site plays a more significant role in promoting the electrocatalytic efficiency of these catalysts.

The Co$_x$B-[0.2]P-O electrodes show excellent long-term stability after 1000 CV cycles even under alkaline operation conditions as demonstrated by well overlapping LSV curves before and after cycling. Furthermore, the $R_{ct}$ values remain unchanged (Fig. 5 A). Post-operation SEM micrographs further confirm the preservation of the original morphology with only slightly thickened nanosheets (cf. Fig. 1 B-C, Fig. 5 B-D, and Fig. S4) corroborating the excellent mechanical stability during operation.

The strong anchorage of the catalyst even after the stability test on the highly porous and conductive 3D metal substrates provides a major advantage in contrast to conventional drop-casted coatings.$^{[51]}$
Conclusion

A facile, cost and resource-effective method has been developed to prepare self-supported, highly efficient and long-term stable Pt-like CoₓB-[0.2]P-O electrocatalyst for HER. A comprehensive scale-bridging investigation of the microstructure and chemistry of the complete electrode with emphasis on the active catalyst material has been employed to explain the enhanced electrocatalytic and Pt-competitive HER performance of the electrode in comparison to previous CoₓB based catalysts. Its superior performance is attributed to the complex heterostructured morphology with co-existing crystalline and amorphous phases. Additionally, the modulation of the Co active site chemistry and ligand field due to the incorporation of both, boron and phosphorous species, promotes extrinsic and intrinsic catalytic activity and reduced charge transfer resistance. The comprehensive investigation unraveled the complex interplay between morphology, crystal structure, chemistry and bonding required for the successful production of highly efficient electrocatalysts. This work demonstrated a quite simple synthesis strategy and facilitates the development of more complex earth-abundant transition metal electrocatalysts with high activity toward electrochemical reactions for water splitting.
