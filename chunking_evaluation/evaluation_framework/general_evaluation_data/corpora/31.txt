1. Introduction
Quantum computing is a game changer in the world of technology, offering the potential to tackle problems that traditional computers struggle with[1]. Unlike computers that rely on bits, quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition and entanglement principles. This unique capability enables quantum computers to perform calculations more efficiently than classical systems, significantly impacting areas like cryptography, optimization, machine learning, and simulations [2].

Liquid crystals have played a role in shaping technology, especially in the advancement of display technologies. Discovered back in 1888 by the botanist and chemist Friedrich Reinitzer, liquid crystals made an impact with the creation of the liquid crystal display (LCD) by George H. Heilmeier in the 1960s[3]. Since then, these liquid crystals have been pivotal in driving innovations due to their unique properties that combine features of solid crystals and isotropic liquids[4]. Researchers are currently exploring their potential in quantum computing, where their capacity to manipulate light at a quantum level could pave the way for scalable quantum systems[5].

The use of Liquid crystals in quantum computing is motivated by their electro-optical characteristics, which make them well-suited for manipulating photons—an essential aspect in quantum systems. Liquid crystals are
highly beneficial for their capacity to manage the polarization states of photons, which is a requirement for optical quantum gates to function. These gates carry out operations on qubits, a process in quantum computing. Moreover, liquid crystals have the ability to adjust phases at extremely low levels of photon counts, aiding in preserving the fragile quantum states of qubits with minimal interference and decoherence—significant hurdles faced by current quantum computing technologies [6,7]. Liquid crystals offer another benefit in the realm of quantum computing. Their ability to seamlessly integrate with computing materials and substrates. This seamless integration not only proves cost-effective but also paves the way for the creation of yet powerful quantum computing devices, as evidenced in a range of experimental configurations [7]. The capacity to combine liquid crystals with materials opens up avenues for future commercialization and expansion of quantum computing technology.

1.1 Fundamentals of Liquid Crystals

Liquid crystals are a form of matter that shows characteristics of both crystals and liquids. They have an arrangement akin to solids while retaining the fluidity of liquids. This dual behavior allows them to react to influences like magnetic fields, which can change their molecular orientation and, thereby, affect their optical traits [8]. These qualities are crucial for their use in quantum computing, where accurate manipulation of quantum states is essential.

1.2 Phases of Liquid Crystals

Liquid crystals can be categorized into various phases based on their molecular arrangement and the properties they exhibit. The most common phases of liquid crystals are nematic, smectic, and cholesteric (or chiral), with each phase offering unique advantages for different applications:

1.3 Physical and Chemical Properties

Liquid crystals are characterized by their anisotropy, which means their properties vary depending on the direction of measurement. This anisotropy arises from the unique rod-like or discotic shape of their molecules and their regular packing in space. The most notable forms of anisotropy in liquid crystals include:

- **Electrical Anisotropy**: This allows liquid crystals to modulate light propagation, which is critical for display technologies and is increasingly important in quantum computing applications.
- **Optical Anisotropy**: This property influences how light interacts with the material, often resulting in phenomena such as birefringence, which is used in optical switches and modulators.
- **Magnetic Anisotropy**: Similar to electrical anisotropy, this property affects how liquid crystals respond to magnetic fields, which can also be utilized in quantum computing.

Other significant properties include viscosity and elasticity, which are also direction-dependent, as well as the thermal properties that influence phase transitions.

Liquid crystals' ability to change their optical properties in response to external electric fields is one of their most valuable characteristics for quantum computing. This electro-optical behavior enables the precise control of light's polarization state and phase, which is essential for the operation of quantum gates and other optical components in quantum computers.

Quantum computing explores the quantum properties found in liquid crystals. These materials play a role in manipulating the quantum states of photons acting as qubits. Liquid crystals stand out for their anisotropic qualities and ability to respond to influences, enabling precise functions like preparing, manipulating, and measuring quantum states with exceptional accuracy and minimal energy usage, as extensively discussed in this review.

Throughout this review, we will look at the phases of liquid crystals, focusing on their unique characteristics and possible uses in quantum computing. Specifically, we will examine Twisted Nematic liquid crystals (TN LCs), which have shown great potential in quantum applications, particularly in accurately controlling light phase and polarization within quantum systems. Applying TN LCs in arrangements like the Mach Zehnder interferometer has proven its effectiveness in modulating light using minimal energy. This positions them as contenders for advancing quantum computing technologies.

Moreover, we will discuss other intriguing phases of liquid crystals, such as ferroelectric liquid crystals, particularly the Smectic C* phase, which offers bistability and rapid switching times—key characteristics for qubit stability and coherence. These properties make ferroelectric liquid crystals highly viable for developing quantum gates. Additionally, the emerging class of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals presents exciting opportunities for enhancing quantum system fault tolerance and coherence times while enabling the efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. These advancements position liquid crystals as pivotal materials in the ongoing development of quantum computing, promising enhanced performance and scalability.
2. Quantum Coherence and Entanglement in Liquid Crystals

Quantum coherence refers to the phenomenon in a quantum system where particles exhibit wave correlations. In the realm of Liquid crystals, quantum coherence can be observed as the behavior of molecules maintaining phase connections over long distances. This kind of coherence plays a role in the functioning of systems such as quantum computers and sensors, where preserving quantum states without decoherence is essential. Liquid crystal (LC) devices, like twisted TN) LCs, have the ability to manipulate light polarization, phase, and rotation, making them well-suited for optical quantum computing applications. Terazawa and colleagues investigated optical logic operations using TN LCs in a Mach Zehnder interferometer to control quantum light interference. They demonstrated alterations in optical interference states and photon counts at levels [15]. These LC devices facilitate encoding quantum bits (qubits) by modifying the polarization state of light, enabling the superposition of 0 and 1 states for executing quantum logic operations.

Studies have showcased how we can control the polarization of light in pathways using TN LCs in setups like Mach Zehnder interferometers [15]. Studies by Terazawa and colleagues demonstrated alterations in optical interference patterns, and photon counts at different levels, highlighting the potential for incorporating LC devices into logic operation elements. In their experiment, a change in interference pattern was observed when voltage was applied to the TN LC cell, resulting in fluctuations in photon numbers under weak lighting conditions. At 1 V, there was no interference due to a 90-degree shift in laser beam polarizations. However, at voltages of 2 V or higher, interference patterns started emerging as the laser beam polarization gradually changed. The study revealed a ring pattern in the interference image, indicating the interference between two laser beams, with fringe patterns shifting as the voltage increased. Photon counting experiments showed a decrease in photon counts and saturation at 0.77 counts at 5 V, underscoring alterations in interference scenarios with changes in voltage [15]. These findings underscore the effectiveness of TN LCs in achieving quantum coherence and controlling optical interference states, setting the stage for advancements in quantum information processing. Harnessing the potential to manipulate quantum coherence and entanglement within crystals shows prospects for advancing cutting-edge quantum technologies.

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become entangled in such a way that one particle’s
state instantly influences another’s state, regardless of distance. This fundamental feature of quantum mechanics has significant consequences for quantum computers, communication, and cryptography. Recent research has delved into how liquid crystals, particularly q-plates, patterned, non-uniform LC, specifically designed liquid crystal cells with patterns to manipulate photons’ quantum properties for various quantum information applications.

These q-plates are essential in producing entangled polarization states and orbital angular momentum of photons, transmitting quantum information between distinct photon characteristics, and enabling quantum cloning of orbital angular momentum-encoded qubits [15]. The coupling is essential for creating entangled states where the polarization and OAM of photons are interdependent. [15] This is demonstrated in several key experiments showcasing the quantum capabilities of q-plates, as discussed below.

2.1 Generation of Entangled States

Q-plates can produce entangled states of polarization and OAM for a single photon. When a photon passes through a q-plate, its polarization state becomes entangled with its OAM. For example, a linearly polarized photon input produces an entangled state as follows:

\[ | \text{H} \rangle \rightarrow \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| \text{R} \rangle + | \text{L} \rangle ) \]

Here, |H\rangle is the horizontal polarization state, |R\rangle and |L\rangle are the right and left circular polarization states, and |±2\rangle denotes the OAM states\[16,17\].

2.2 Quantum information transfer

Q-plates promote quantum information transfer between photon polarization and OAM. This transfer is critical for quantum communication and computation because it permits multiple degrees of freedom of a photon to be used when encoding information. The experiments demonstrated efficient transmission mechanisms with high fidelity\[17\].

2.3 Hong-Ou-Mandel Coalescence

The Hong Ou Mandel effect showcases the merging of two photons into a mode through interference. It was verified by employing photons with non-zero orbital angular momentum (OAM). This occurrence exemplifies quantum properties. Highlights the effectiveness of q plates in quantum optical studies\(^{(17,18)}\).

2.4 Quantum Cloning

The q plates were used to enhance the quantum replication of qubits encoded in OAM states. Quantum cloning involves copying information in a quantum state into states, which is crucial for error correction and quantum communication protocols. The experiments demonstrated that when photons traverse these q plates, their polarization states are transformed into OAM states and vice versa, maintaining quantum coherence and entanglement. The effectiveness of these processes was evaluated through photon counting and analysis of interference patterns, which showed accuracy and minimal loss of photons [16].

3. Liquid Crystals as Quantum systems

Recently, there has been a growing interest in using liquid crystals in quantum information technology as single photon sources (SPS) for applications in quantum communication and computing [7,13,15]. Although liquid crystals are not quantum systems in the classic sense, they have unique features that can be used in quantum applications. Below is a look at their potential and current research status:

3.1 Tunable optical properties.

Liquid crystals have tunable optical properties through molecule orientation twists along the sample or by introducing an electric field, allowing for dynamic modulation of the polarization state of photon pairs. The modification of LC molecule orientation offers remarkable tunability of two-photon states, allowing for quantum-state creation with pixel-wise tunable optical characteristics [10,11]. This tunability is critical for creating quantum devices that need precise control over light-matter interactions. The unique molecular twist structure of liquid crystals enables reconfigurable quasi-phase matching, which helps achieve photon pairs’ desired spectral and polarization properties [18]. Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLC), known for their responsiveness to influences, are highly valued for their precise adjustment of optical properties in real-time, a crucial aspect for applications in quantum optics [13]. Sultanov and colleagues discovered the phenomenon of SPDC (spontaneous down conversion) in a nematic liquid crystal (FNLC) for the first time, marking a significant milestone in liquid crystal and organic material research [18]. The FNLC exhibited a rate comparable to top nonlinear crystals, showcasing the potential of FNLCs as effective generators of entangled photons.
The research also found that changing a field influenced how the FNLC molecules were aligned, impacting the polarization of the photon pairs produced. Adjusting the field enabled instant tuning of optical characteristics, as the polarization of photon pairs could be switched between horizontal and vertical orientations. Moreover, the study illustrated the alterations in the polarization state of two photons when influenced by a field. Using polarization tomography, the scientists reconstructed the density matrix of the two-photon states. The study revealed that adjusting the orientation with an applied field made it possible to change the two-photon polarization state from horizontal to vertical or any point in between. One significant finding was the Broadband Photon Pair Spectrum analysis from the photon pairs generated through two-photon fiber spectroscopy. The spectrum showed a mainly even distribution, suggesting that FNLCs could produce photon pairs spanning wavelengths, which could be helpful for tasks requiring precise temporal resolution and complex quantum encoding. The findings indicate that FNLCs hold promise as adjustable quantum light sources. The ability to alter alignment using a field is a valuable method for controlling the characteristics of generated photon pairs, positioning liquid crystals as a promising material for upcoming quantum technology endeavors.

### 3.2 Integration with Quantum Dots.

Studies have shown that when quantum dots (QDs) are paired with Liquid crystals (LCs), they can display distinct quantum characteristics that are beneficial for various purposes, like generating single photons and producing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL)\[^{14,19}\]. This review also explores how liquid crystals and quantum dots are combined, focusing on how this affects quantum systems. Quantum dots are semiconductor crystals with properties such as distinct energy levels and optical characteristics that vary based on their size. When paired with liquid crystals, they form systems that merge the adjustability of LCs with the quantum traits of QDs\[^{19,20}\]. Recent studies discovered that by adding quantum dots to blue phase liquid crystal elastomers (BPLCEs), they were able to create color-changing circularly polarized light (CPL) effects\[^{14}\]. Unlike liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs), BPLCEs, with their 3D cubic superstructure, exhibit opposing CPL signals independent of photonic bandgaps (PBG). This configuration allows for high luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum), which is ideal for counterfeiting applications. Moreover, liquid crystal polymers have shown responsiveness to stimuli like temperature, pH, and electric fields. By leveraging this responsiveness in quantum systems, researchers can develop materials with valuable characteristics for applications such as information storage and anti-counterfeiting measures. It is also worth noting that producing QD-doped LC films requires photopolymerization and precise control over QD distribution inside the LC matrix. This approach assures uniform dispersion of QDs, which is critical for achieving consistent optical characteristics and high-performance quantum systems. Combining liquid crystals and quantum dots is a potential approach to creating Tunable and responsive quantum systems. These hybrid materials' increased optical characteristics and stimulus-responsive behavior hold great promise for advances in quantum information technology. Future research should focus on improving integration techniques and investigating novel applications in quantum communication, encryption, and optical storage.

### 3.3 Photonic Bandgap Materials

Photonic bandgap (PBG) materials are structures that limit light propagation within a specified range of wavelengths, resulting in a photonic bandgap in which specific frequencies cannot pass through the material. With their distinct optical characteristics and reconfigurability, liquid crystals are increasingly exploited to create these PBG materials. This feature is critical for creating sophisticated photonic circuits and quantum communication systems. In this review, we also looked at Liquid crystals that can be utilized to construct photonic bandgap materials that control the flow of photons. Liquid crystals (LCs) have variable optical characteristics, making them excellent for creating photonic bandgap materials. These materials utilize LCs' anisotropy to develop structures that dynamically control photon flow. LCs' reconfigurability enables real-time tweaking of the photonic bandgap, making them highly adaptable for various quantum system applications\[^{21,22}\]. Photonic circuits are critical in quantum communication systems because they can modify and transfer information via light. Liquid crystals embedded with photonic bandgap materials improve the functionality of these circuits by allowing for dynamic control of photon flow. This dynamic control is critical for applications in quantum information processing and secure communication networks\[^{23}\]. Integrating crystal layers into structures allows for dynamically altering the refractive index through external
triggers, like electric fields. This capability enables the manipulation of band gaps, which is essential for developing adaptable photonic tools and circuits\[^{21}\].

A recent study on integrating liquid crystals with photonic bandgap materials for quantum systems has yielded promising results. Studies have shown that photonic crystal cavities may effectively couple nano emitters to photonic integrated circuits with excellent quality factors and small mode volumes\[^{21}\]. These advancements open up possibilities for quantum technology by enabling effective interactions between light and matter. By manipulating the polarization and phase of light with LCs integrated into waveguides, we can create electromodulators. These modulators can dynamically adjust states, which is crucial for signal processing within photonic circuits\[^{22}\].

Ensuring data transmission is an aspect of quantum communication. Using LCs in bandgap materials allows for the development of reliable QKD (Quantum key distribution) systems. The dynamic control offered by LCs over photon properties enhances the flexibility and security of QKD systems, making them more resilient to interception or eavesdropping attempts\[^{21,23}\].

Individual photons must be precisely controlled for quantum communication to occur. LCs serve as a medium for fine-tuning photon properties within photonic bandgap structures, supporting efficient photon routing, entanglement distribution, and other key quantum activities\[^{22}\]. While there are advantages, we discovered that incorporating LCs into systems comes with challenges. The extensive and expensive process of developing integrated chips hinders their widespread use. Yet progress in devices where LCs have a crucial role could significantly reduce development expenses, expedite market entry, and enhance sustainability. Future studies ought to focus on improving the stability and response times of LC-based materials and exploring manufacturing methods for seamless integration into quantum systems\[^{21,22}\].
