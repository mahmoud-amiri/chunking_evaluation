1. Introduction

1.1 Overview of Textile Industry Waste
The textile industry is one of the largest global producers of polymeric waste, with synthetic fibers such as polyester, nylon, and spandex being the primary culprits. Polyester, in particular, is the most widely used fiber, accounting for over 60% of global textile production, but its non-biodegradability has led to significant environmental concerns [1]. This results in the accumulation of waste in landfills and contributes to microplastic pollution in oceans and waterways, a growing concern for both the environment and human health [2]. It is estimated that approximately 92 million tons of textile waste are generated annually, with much of it being sent to landfills or incinerated [3]. The durability and long lifespan of these synthetic fibers mean they persist in the environment for hundreds of years, making them a major contributor to the ongoing environmental crisis.

1.2 Need for Sustainable Alternatives
As demand for textiles continues to rise, the need for sustainable materials has never been more urgent. Industries such as construction, automotive, and packaging are increasingly turning to alternative materials that are biodegradable and eco-friendly [4]. Biodegradable composites, derived from waste materials like textile waste, offer a promising solution by reducing reliance on petroleum-based materials and providing an opportunity to create products that are both functional and environmentally responsible [5]. These composites not only mitigate waste issues but also contribute to the development of a circular economy, where products are
designed with their end-of-life in mind, reducing overall waste and conserving natural resources [6].

1.3 Purpose of the Review

The primary purpose of this review is to investigate the potential for repurposing textile polymer waste into biodegradable composites that can serve as sustainable alternatives in various industries. This paper will examine the different methods used to transform textile waste into biodegradable composites, such as mechanical, chemical, and biological recycling techniques [7]. The review will address the challenges related to material quality, processing techniques, and cost efficiency, while also exploring the opportunities presented by these sustainable alternatives in terms of environmental impact and economic potential. By focusing on both the potential and limitations, this review aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge on sustainable material solutions and waste-to-wealth initiatives in the textile industry.

2. Polymeric Waste in the Textile Industry

2.1 Types of Polymeric Waste

The textile industry primarily generates polymeric waste from synthetic fibers, such as polyester, nylon, and spandex, which are widely used due to their durability, low cost, and versatility. Among these, polyester is the most commonly used synthetic fiber, comprising approximately 60% of global textile production [8]. It is favored for its strength, resistance to shrinking, and ability to retain color, making it popular in clothing, home textiles, and technical textiles. Similarly, nylon, another popular synthetic polymer, is used in products ranging from apparel to carpets and industrial fabrics due to its high strength and elasticity [9]. Spandex is another widely used fiber, particularly in activewear and sportswear, due to its stretch ability and comfort.

While these synthetic polymers offer functional benefits, they present significant environmental challenges. These fibers are non-biodegradable, meaning they can persist in the environment for hundreds of years, contributing to the growing problem of plastic pollution [10]. When disposed of improperly, they accumulate in landfills or water bodies, where they break down into microplastics, posing serious threats to marine life and ecosystems [11].

2.2 Generation and Disposal

The textile industry is a major producer of polymeric waste globally, with over 92 million tons of textile waste generated annually [12]. This waste includes both post-consumer waste (old clothes and textiles) and post-industrial waste (scraps and defects from production). A significant portion of textile waste consists of synthetic fibers, which are often non-recyclable using traditional recycling methods.

Current disposal practices for textile waste predominantly include landfilling and incineration. Landfilling is the most common method, where waste is buried in the ground, leading to long-term environmental issues, including land degradation and the release of greenhouse gases from decomposing waste [12]. Incineration, another prevalent disposal method, involves burning the waste at high temperatures. Although this reduces the volume of waste, it often results in the release of harmful emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other pollutants, contributing to air pollution and the depletion of natural resources [9].
Both of these disposal methods contribute to the environmental burden of textile waste. However, the limitations of current disposal methods have spurred interest in sustainable alternatives, including the development of biodegradable composites from repurposed textile waste.

2.3 Challenges with Textile Waste

Recycling textile polymer waste presents several challenges due to the inherent properties of synthetic fibers. One of the primary challenges is their durability—synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon are designed to be long-lasting and resistant to environmental degradation, which makes them difficult to break down in natural systems. As a result, these polymers do not readily biodegrade, making them problematic for traditional waste management systems [8].

Moreover, many textiles undergo chemical treatments during production to enhance their appearance, durability, or performance. These treatments can include dyes, flame retardants, anti-wrinkle finishes, and water-repellent coatings. These additives often complicate the recycling process, as they can interfere with the chemical properties of the fibers, making them harder to process into new materials [7]. In addition, the blended nature of textiles, which often combine multiple types of fibers (e.g., polyester-cotton blends), further complicates recycling efforts, as it is challenging to separate the fibers for individual recycling.

The non-biodegradability, durability, and complex chemical treatments of synthetic textile fibers make them difficult to recycle using conventional recycling methods. As a result, innovative approaches are needed to repurpose these materials into sustainable products, such as biodegradable composites, to address both the growing textile waste problem and the environmental impact of synthetic polymers.

3. Repurposing Polymeric Waste into Biodegradable Composites

3.1 Biodegradable Composites Overview

Biodegradable composites are materials made by combining biodegradable polymers with other sustainable components to create composite materials that can decompose naturally over time without causing harm to the environment. These composites are considered a promising solution to the growing problem of plastic and textile waste, as they can replace non-biodegradable polymers, which often accumulate in landfills and water bodies, contributing to long-term pollution [5]. By integrating repurposed textile polymer waste into biodegradable composites, it is possible to reduce the amount of synthetic fiber waste in the environment while creating new materials with a range of applications. These composites offer several advantages, such as enhanced mechanical properties, lightweight nature, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Importantly, the use of biodegradable polymers, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and starch-based biopolymers, ensures that these materials can break down after their lifecycle, minimizing their environmental footprint [7].
3.2 Repurposing Methods

There are various approaches to repurposing textile polymer waste into biodegradable composites, each with its unique processes and benefits. The three most prominent methods are mechanical recycling, chemical recycling, and biological degradation. These methods offer innovative solutions to address the challenges posed by textile waste.

3.3 Mechanical Recycling

Mechanical recycling involves the physical processing of textile waste to create new materials. In this process, textile waste, such as shredded polyester, nylon fibers, or spandex, is collected and ground into smaller pieces or fibers. These ground fibers can then be mixed with biodegradable polymers, such as PLA or PHA, to form composite materials with enhanced properties. Mechanical recycling typically includes steps like shredding, compounding, and extrusion to blend the waste fibers with biodegradable matrices [5]. This method is straightforward, energy-efficient, and cost-effective, but the quality of the final composite can sometimes be limited by the degradation of the polymeric fibers during processing.

3.4 Chemical Recycling

Chemical recycling, also known as depolymerization, involves breaking down polymeric waste into its monomers through chemical processes. For instance, polyester can be depolymerized back into its monomer, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, through processes such as glycolysis or hydrolysis. These monomers can then be used to synthesize new biodegradable polymer composites, either through polymerization or by blending with biodegradable polymers such as PLA or PHA [7]. This method allows for a more controlled and high-quality recycling process, potentially yielding new, high-performance biodegradable composites suitable for various applications. However, chemical recycling requires more energy and complex infrastructure compared to mechanical recycling.

3.5 Biological Degradation

Biological degradation leverages natural processes, such as enzymatic or microbial degradation, to break down polymeric waste into simpler, biodegradable forms. Certain microorganisms and enzymes are capable of metabolizing synthetic polymers such as polyester, converting them into biodegradable products [11]. In this process, specific enzymes, like polyester hydrolases, are used to catalyse the breakdown of polyester into its monomeric components, which can then be further processed into biodegradable composites [6]. Although biological degradation is still in its early stages of development, it shows great promise as an environmentally friendly and energy-efficient approach to recycling textile waste. However, challenges remain regarding the efficiency and scalability of these processes.

3.6 Case Studies

Several real-world examples highlight the successful conversion of textile waste into biodegradable composites. These case studies showcase the potential for textile waste repurposing in various industries.

1. Construction Materials: One notable case is the use of recycled textile waste in the production of biodegradable composites for construction applications. Researchers have successfully integrated shredded polyester fibers into biodegradable matrices.
made from natural fibers like jute or hemp. These composites have shown promising mechanical properties and durability while maintaining biodegradability, making them suitable for low-impact construction materials [6].

2. Automotive Parts: Another application of biodegradable composites from textile waste is in the automotive industry. Studies have demonstrated that recycled polyester fibers, when combined with biodegradable resins, can be used to manufacture automotive components such as interior panels and insulation materials. These composites reduce the environmental impact of car manufacturing by substituting petroleum-based materials and offering a sustainable alternative for parts that require lower weight and higher performance [8].

3. Packaging: Textile waste has also been successfully repurposed into biodegradable packaging materials. Researchers have explored the use of recycled polyester in combination with biodegradable polymer matrices like PLA to produce biodegradable packaging films. These packaging materials can decompose naturally and offer a more sustainable option compared to conventional plastic packaging, which takes hundreds of years to break down in landfills [7].

4. Challenges in Repurposing Polymeric Waste from Textiles

The transition from conventional textile waste disposal to the development of biodegradable composites faces several scientific, technical, and economic challenges. While repurposing textile waste can provide a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics, several key obstacles must be addressed to enhance feasibility and large-scale adoption.

4.1 Material Quality and Performance

One of the primary challenges in repurposing polymeric textile waste into biodegradable composites is ensuring material quality and mechanical performance. The physical and chemical properties of synthetic fibers (e.g., polyester, nylon, spandex) are often altered by dyes, finishes, and other treatments applied during textile manufacturing. These modifications can negatively impact the compatibility of textile waste with biodegradable polymers and reduce the strength, flexibility, and durability of the final composite [13].

Additionally, textile waste fibers are often heterogeneous, meaning they vary in composition, length, and degradation levels. This inconsistency can lead to non-uniform mechanical properties in the final product, affecting its structural integrity and performance. For biodegradable composites to be successfully commercialized, solutions such as fiber pre-treatment, compatibilizers, and reinforcement additives must be explored to enhance material performance while maintaining sustainability [8].

4.2 Processing Issues

Processing textile waste into biodegradable composites presents technical difficulties at various stages of the recycling process. Some key challenges include:

- Separation and Sorting: Textile waste often consists of blended fibers (e.g., polyester-cotton, nylon-elastane), making separation complex. Advanced sorting technologies such as infrared spectroscopy or enzymatic treatments are needed to improve fiber purity [14].
Contaminant Removal: Textile waste is frequently contaminated with dyes, chemicals, and finishing agents, which can affect the quality and biodegradability of the resulting composite. Effective pre-treatment processes like chemical washing and biodegradation-assisted purification need to be developed.

Material Consistency: The mechanical recycling process (shredding and reprocessing) can lead to fiber degradation, reducing the mechanical strength of the composite material. Maintaining uniform fiber length and structure is essential to achieving high-quality biodegradable composites.

Despite these challenges, innovations in fiber separation, purification, and composite formulation are emerging, offering potential solutions for industrial applications.

4.3 Biodegradability vs. Durability

An inherent challenge in biodegradable composites is balancing biodegradability with mechanical durability. While the goal is to create biodegradable materials, they must also maintain sufficient strength and stability during use. Textiles made from synthetic polymers like polyester and nylon are designed for durability, meaning they resist degradation under natural conditions [6].

A significant concern is that incorporating textile waste into biodegradable composites may reduce the overall biodegradation rate of the final material. For example:

- High polyester content in the composite can slow down microbial degradation.
- Blended fibers containing both biodegradable and non-biodegradable components may lead to incomplete degradation, resulting in microplastic pollution.
- Moisture sensitivity of biodegradable polymers (e.g., PLA) can compromise material strength in humid environments.

To overcome these issues, biodegradation enhancers, such as enzymatic catalysts or biodegradable additives, can be introduced to accelerate the breakdown of synthetic fibers while preserving material strength [7].

4.4 Cost and Scalability

Economic feasibility remains one of the biggest barriers to large-scale adoption of biodegradable composites from textile waste. The challenges include:

- High Processing Costs: Recycling and repurposing textile waste require advanced separation, purification, and processing technologies, which can be expensive compared to conventional plastic production [8].
- Raw Material Availability: Although textile waste is abundant, collecting, sorting, and preparing it for composite manufacturing requires additional infrastructure and labor.
- Market Demand and Industrial Adoption: There is still limited awareness and demand for biodegradable composites made from recycled textiles. Manufacturers may hesitate to switch to biodegradable alternatives due to concerns over performance, costs, and processing complexities [5].
Regulatory Barriers: Many industries still lack clear standards and certifications for biodegradable composites, which can delay commercial adoption and investment in research and development (R&D) [14]. However, as governments and industries implement stricter sustainability regulations, demand for eco-friendly materials is expected to rise. Public incentives, government funding, and technological advancements can play a crucial role in making biodegradable textile-based composites more economically viable.

5. Opportunities in Repurposing Textile Waste
