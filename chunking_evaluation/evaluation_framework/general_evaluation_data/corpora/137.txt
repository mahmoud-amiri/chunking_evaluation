ABSTRACT

A mononuclear pentacoordinate Fe(III)-porphyrin-NCS complex has been synthesized and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction, magnetic, electrochemical, spectroscopic, and theoretical studies. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies show a planar porphyrin moiety with an axial NCS coordinated to the Fe(III) centre. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies in solution depict clear changes in the
system during oxidation and reduction processes. Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures also supported the observation of a high-spin state of the Fe(III)-porphyrin complex that was further backed by DFT calculations. Attempts to understand the origin of high magnetic anisotropy in the ground state as determined by DC magnetic measurements was undertaken by detailed CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 calculations.

INTRODUCTION

For many decades, Fe(III) porphyrin systems have been extensively studied in literature on account of their remarkable physical properties and interesting applications\textsuperscript{1-3} as well as their crucial role in biological systems.\textsuperscript{4-8} Porphyrins being large macrocycles, have plenty of electrons forming extended $\pi$-conjugation system due to which they exhibit characteristic electronic\textsuperscript{9-13} and electrochemical properties\textsuperscript{14-16} both in solid state as well as in solution.

Fe(III)$X$ tetraphenylporphyrins ($X=$Br, Cl, I, NCS) usually forms high-spin complexes with $S=5/2$ spin ground state.\textsuperscript{17, 18} Nevertheless, a spin-state switching phenomenon has been observed by Korszun and Mofat\textsuperscript{19} between the five-coordinate high-spin isothiocyanato methaemoglobin and the six-coordinate low-spin histidine ligated isothiocyanato methaemoglobin. Till now, various literature published on the ambidentate thiocyancate ligand ligated Fe(III) tetraphenylporphyrin have shown the electronic and magnetic properties in solution along with their theoretical justification.\textsuperscript{20-23} However, a complete electrochemical study in solution as well as magnetic properties in the solid state have not been investigated so far. Proper justification of the high-spin state of Fe(III) with uniaxial anisotropy in this particular coordination environment is also another area of interest that requires considerable knowledge of the crystal and electronic structure of these mononuclear porphyrins. On the other hand, the modification of the tetraphenylporphyrin ligand by incorporating a methoxy group at the $p$-position of the aldehyde moiety may lead to a structural phase transition in the system because the methoxy group is known to show change in geometry at different temperatures.\textsuperscript{24-26}
In this work we have synthesized the isothiocyanato ligated five coordinated square pyramidal Fe(III) tetraphenylporphyrin complex FeTMPP(NCS).CH$_3$CN (1) and have explored the structural, electronic, electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical and magnetic properties and have also explained these properties by theoretical calculations and modelling (H$_2$TMPP = p-methoxytetraphenylporphyrin), in attempts to realize their suitable candidature for molecular magnetic systems$^{27,28}$.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

**Synthesis and characterization.** The reaction of FeTMPPCl (H$_2$TMPP = p-methoxytetraphenylporphyrin) with NH$_4$SCN in CH$_3$CN/EtOH (1:1) resulted in a dark-red solution that, on slow evaporation, yielded violet block rectangular crystals in good yield. The purity of 1 was confirmed by elemental analyses and PXRD measurement (Figure SI-8). The TGA analysis of 1 (Figure SI-1) shows that it is stable up to 545 K, after which it steadily loses 3 % weight till 573 K for the removal of one acetonitrile molecule. The experimental PXRD pattern (at 298 K) matches well with the simulated pattern (at 295 K), confirming the bulk phase purity of the system.

Crystal Structures Analyses. Single crystal X-ray structure analyses were carried out on a suitable single crystal of 1 at 100 K, 250 K, and 295 K (Table 1-3), where 1 crystallized in monoclinic space group $P 2_1/n$ ($Z=4$). The asymmetric unit (Figure 2) at all the measured temperatures contains the five-coordinate thiocyanato ligated to the iron porphyrin complex along with one acetonitrile molecule, which appears as solvent of crystallization. The iron centre is bonded to four donor pyrrole nitrogen atoms from the porphyrin moiety and at the axial position to the N end of the ambidentate thiocyanate ligand, adopting a spherical square pyramidal geometry at all the temperatures as determined from continuous shape measures (CShM) program29 (Table 4). The Fe-N$_{eq}$ bond distances lie in the range of [2.058 - 2.067] Å, which is close to the value for the high-spin iron-complex at this temperature$^{30,31}$, whereas the Fe-N$_{NCS}$ bond distances, follow an anomalous trend where the maximum bond length of 2.026 Å is observed at 100 K, after which there is a decrease to 2.007 Å at 250 K and 2.005 Å at 295 K. The N$_{NCS}$-Fe-N$_{eq}$ bond angles deviate from the ideal 90 ° and fall in the range of [101.4 – 105.0] ° whereas the N-Fe-N (eq) bond angles are also not linear with average values of 153.85, 153.70, and 154.10 ° at 100 K, 250 K, and 295 K respectively. This also indicated that the iron centre does not fit well in the porphyrin cavity and is slightly above the porphyrin plane, like a typical SAT metallloporphyrin complex$^{32}$.

There are several intermolecular interactions (short contacts) present in the molecule; firstly, two sets of non-covalent C...H interactions between the C atom of the phenyl ring and the H atom of acetonitrile were present. Again, a set of S...C interactions arise from the S centre of NCS- unit and C atom of para-methoxy group. Also, there are weak S...H hydrogen bonding interactions coming from the S centre of NCS- and H atom of phenyl ring and N...H interactions between N of acetonitrile and H atom of phenyl ring (Figure SI-2). Careful analyses of the structure also revealed that the thermal distortions were more at higher temperatures which can be seen from the slight deviation of the FeIII-NCS bond and the Ph-OMe bonds (Figure 3).

**Spectroscopic studies.** It is well known that porphyrins display characteristic electronic spectra and the UV-Vis/NIR spectroscopy is used to give an insight into the electronic states of the metalloporphyrin complex. The solid-state spectrum of 1 (Figure SI-4) displays a characteristic strong absorption band at 431 nm, which is ascribed to the Soret band and two relatively weaker bands at 520 nm and 625 nm due to the Q-bands coming from the porphyrin moiety. A weak band centered at around 718 nm can be assigned to the ligand-to-metal charge-transfer band coming from NCS-→FeIII center. There is another broad band at around 979 nm which can be attributed to the d-d transitions coming from the FeIII centre (5A1 ← 4T1). The UV-Vis/NIR measurements were also carried out in Dichloromethane, Benzonitrile, Acetone and N,N-Dimethylformamide solvents (Figure SI-4) which displays a similar nature as that of the solid-state spectrum.
IR spectroscopy is a useful tool to understand the nature of the stretching vibrations of the different bonds present in metal complexes and the thiocyanate stretching frequency ($\nu_{\text{NCS}}$) is quite sensitive to the oxidation state and spin state of the bridged metal centre. FT-IR measurements carried out on 1 (Figure SI- 3) show two characteristic $\nu_{\text{NCS}}$ stretches at 2023 and 2008 cm$^{-1}$, coming from the Fe$^{\text{III}}$-NCS bond. The IR spectrum also shows the characteristic $\nu_{\text{C-H}}$ stretch at 2835 cm$^{-1}$ and the $\nu_{\text{C=N}}$ stretching vibration at 1604 cm$^{-1}$.

Variable-temperature IR studies were performed on 1 in the temperature range of 300- 430 K (Figure SI- 5) in both cooling and heating modes. While increasing the temperature to 430 K, the $\nu_{\text{NCS}}$ stretch at 2023 cm$^{-1}$ disappears at 360 K (Figure SI- 6) and reappears during the heating cycle showing the reversible nature of the change. This changes is probably due to the distortion taking place in the Fe(III)-NCS bond at this temperature. An isosbestic point is also observed at 1330 cm$^{-1}$ both in heating and cooling modes (Figure SI- 7). All these changes demonstrate that the system is undergoing some physicochemical change at high temperatures.

**Variable-temperature paramagnetic $^1$H-NMR studies.** To gain a deeper understanding of the spectroscopic properties of 1 in solution, paramagnetic $^1$H-NMR measurements were carried out in CDCl$_3$ solvent in the temperature range of 243 K- 303 K. The VT-NMR spectrum shows the up-field shift of the $\beta$-H (pyrrole) upon increasing the temperature, which is characteristic of a typical paramagnetic system with unpaired electron (Figure 4). It is noteworthy to mention here that the ruffling of the porphyrin core shortens the Fe-N$_p$ bond distances, which destabilizes the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals that increase the contribution of the intermediate-spin state, which is responsible for this nature in the NMR spectrum. The $\delta T$ vs. $T$ and $\delta/T$ vs. $T$ plots have also been shown where in the latter plot, the linear decrease with increasing temperature corresponds to a typical high-spin trend as determined by the Curie law (Figure SI- 10).

Variable-temperature Mössbauer studies. To determine the exact nature (both oxidation and spin states) of the iron centre in 1, Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements were performed in the solid state both for the solvated and desolvated phases at different temperatures (Table 5). For the solvated phase, the isomer shift ($\delta$) and quadrupole-splitting ($\Delta E_Q$) parameters at 10 K ($\delta = 0.42$ mms$^{-1}$, $\Delta E_Q = 0.75$ mms$^{-1}$) and 50 K ($\delta = 0.38$ mms$^{-1}$, $\Delta E_Q = 0.68$ mms$^{-1}$) fall in the range of a typical high-spin Fe(III) porphyrin$^{36,37}$ (Figure 5). Similarly, for the desolvated phase, the isomer shift ($\delta$) and quadrupole-splitting parameters ($\Delta E_Q$) at 10 K ($\delta = 0.42$ mms$^{-1}$, $\Delta E_Q = 0.83$ mms$^{-1}$), 50 K ($\delta = 0.43$ mms$^{-1}$, $\Delta E_Q = 0.83$ mms$^{-1}$), and 250 K ($\delta = 0.35$ mms$^{-1}$, $\Delta E_Q = 0.80$ mms$^{-1}$) fall in the range of a typical high-spin Fe(III) porphyrin$^{36,37}$ (Figure SI-11).
**Figure 5.** Mössbauer spectra of the solvated phase of 1 recorded at 10 K and 50 K. Blue curves represent the quadrupole doublets of the HS-Fe(III) ions.

**Differential scanning Calorimetry.** Differential scanning calorimetry measurements on 1 were carried out in the temperature range of 300-500 K (Figure SI-12) with different sweep rates varying from 15-5 Kmin⁻¹ to investigate the presence of any first-order transition occurring in the system. Under a sweep rate of 10 Kmin⁻¹ in heating/cooling modes, the DSC thermogram showed a set of reversible peaks at 473/442 K, respectively, indicating that the system undergoes a first-order phase transition probably coming from the configurational changes (θ) of the -OMe group of the porphyrin ring. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated for this process, and the related ΔH values were evaluated to be 3.92 (T↑)/3.35 (T↓) kJmol⁻¹, respectively. The corresponding ΔS values were estimated to be 8.29 (T↑)/7.59 (T↓) JK⁻¹mol⁻¹, respectively.

**Electrochemical Studies.** The electrochemical properties of 1 were investigated by cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry in dichloromethane solvent containing individual sample (~1 mM) with 0.1 M (°Bu₄N)PF₆ as electrolyte at 300 K (Figure SI-13, Figure SI-14, Figure SI-15). The cyclic voltammogram of FeTMPP(NCS) displays four quasi-reversible peaks and three irreversible reduction peaks. In the oxidation cycle, there are four quasi-reversible oxidation peaks. The first one has Epa/Epc...
= +0.967 V/+0.838 V, the second one has $E_{pa}/E_{pc} = +0.623$ V/+0.518 V, the third one has $E_{pa}/E_{pc} = +0.458$ V/+0.391 V and the fourth one has $E_{pa}/E_{pc} = +0.296$ V/+0.193 V all of which come from the oxidation of the porphyrin ring. In the reduction cycle there are three irreversible reduction peaks. The first one with $E_{pa}/E_{pc} = -1.506$ V/-1.632 V and the second one with $E_{pc}= -1.339$ V come from the reduction of the porphyrin ring, while the third irreversible peak $E_{pa}/E_{pc} = -0.582$ V/-0.743 V comes from the Fe(III)/Fe(II) reduction.\textsuperscript{41-46}

Spectroelectrochemical Studies.

Fe(III) porphyrin complexes are known to show interesting spectroelectrochemical characteristics.\textsuperscript{47} To get further insight into the electrochemical properties, the spectroelectrochemistry measurements were carried out on the ligand $\text{H}_2\text{TMPP}$ and 1 in dichloromethane solvent using TBAPF$_6$ as the supporting electrolyte at 300 K. All the potentials have been referenced with respect to ferrocene/ferrocenium. The spectral changes during the redox processes can be seen in Figure 6, Figure SI- 16, Figure SI- 17, and Figure SI- 18.

Spectroelectrochemical studies have been conducted on the ligand $\text{H}_2\text{TMPP}$ in dichloromethane from -0.375 V to +1.0 V (vs. Fe/Fe$^+$) for oxidation and from -0.375 V to -1.50 V (vs. Fe/Fe$^+$) for reduction. Upon oxidation in the anodic cycle, the Soret band at 453 nm decreases in intensity and undergoes a red shift to 481 nm. Also, the Q-band at 688 nm decreases in intensity and undergoes a blue shift to 632 nm. Further, the $\pi-\pi^*$ transition band at 265 nm increases in intensity. These changes occur due to the oxidation of the porphyrin ring to form radical cation and radical dication systems. The removal of electrons from the higher energy levels decreases the probability of the transition ($S_0\rightarrow S_2$ or $S_0\rightarrow S_1$), thus decreasing the intensity of the Soret and Q-bands. These changes are completely reversible in the cathodic cycle. Apart from these changes, there are several isosbestic points in the absorption spectrum indicating the equilibrium between two states\textsuperscript{48, 49} (Figure SI- 16). During the reduction process, in the cathodic cycle, there is a small decrease in intensity for the Soret band (421 nm) and small increase in intensity for the Q-bands. Also, the $\pi-\pi^*$ transition band at 265 nm increases in intensity slightly. These changes occur due to the reduction of the
ligand which reduces the probability of transition. In the anodic cycle, these changes are reversible (Figure SI-17).

**Figure 6.** Solution state spectroelectrochemistry of 1 in 0.1 M (t-Bu4N)PF6/CH2Cl2 over the potential range of -0.38 V - +0.98 V vs. Fe/Fe⁺ in anodic cycle (left) and -0.38 V - -1.50 V vs. Fe/Fe⁺ in cathodic cycle (right). Arrows indicate the change in absorbance with the application of potential.

Spectroelectrochemical properties of 1 have been investigated in dichloromethane solvent from -0.38 V to +0.98 V (vs. Fe/Fe⁺) in the oxidation cycle and from -0.38 V to -1.50 V (vs. Fe/Fe⁺) in the reduction cycle. Upon oxidation, in the anodic cycle, the Soret band at 420 nm decreases in intensity. Also, the π−π* transition band at 322 nm decreases in intensity, and a new band at 377 nm starts to appear. These changes are not quite reversible in the cathodic cycle (Figure 6, Figure SI-18). Such changes can be attributed to oxidation of the porphyrin to generate radical cation. In the reduction process, the absorption spectrum shows changes where the Soret band at 420 nm decreases in intensity in the cathodic cycle. Also, the band at 377 nm almost disappears, while the band at 322 nm increases in intensity. These changes are not quite reversible in the anodic cycle. The spectral changes observed during the reduction process can be ascribed to the reduction of the FeIII metal centre in solution along with the reduction of the porphyrin ring to generate a π anion radical47, 50, 51 (Figure 6, Figure SI-18).

**Magnetic studies.** Magnetic measurements were performed on polycrystalline sample of 1 in the temperature range of 2-300 K under an applied DC field of 1000 and 10000 Oe by determining the thermal dependence of the χT (χ is the magnetic susceptibility equal to M/H per [FeTMPP(NCS).CH3CN] unit) as

a function of temperature (Figure 7, Figure SI-20, Figure SI-21, Figure SI-22, Figure SI-23). At 300 K, the measured $\chi T$ value is 3.68 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K using 1000 Oe applied dc field, which is lower than the spin-only $\chi T$ value of 4.375 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K ($S = 5/2$, $g = 2.0$) that is expected for one Fe(III) centre in high-spin state. This lower $\chi T$ value suggesting that there may be a mixing of two different spin states, sextet $^6A_1$ and quartet $^4A_2$. On lowering the temperature, the $\chi T$ value decreases to a value of 2.83 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 10 K and then abruptly decreases to 2.12 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at the lowest temperature (2 K) which is may be due to the combined effect of the zero-field splitting and the weak intermolecular antiferromagnetic interactions in the system. Upon increasing the temperature, the $\chi T$ value increases abruptly to 3.43 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 50 K and then increases slightly to 3.68 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K using 10000 Oe applied DC field, which remains constant up to 300 K (Figure 7).

**Figure 7.** Temperature dependence of $\chi T$ product for 1 at 1000 Oe (blue curve, cooling) and 10000 Oe (red curve, heating) from 2-300 K and Field dependence of the magnetization as $M$ vs $H$ plots for 1 at 2, 5, 6 and 8 K (inset).

The field-dependent magnetization measurements from 0 – 4 T at 2, 5, 6 and 8 K shows that the magnetization value is 2.75 $\mu_B$ at 2 K and 4 T (Figure 7, inset). The value is much lower than the value expected for Fe$^{III}_{HS}$ ($S = 5/2$). Also, the $M$ vs. $H/T$ curve shows the non-superposition of data at different
temperatures on a single master curve, indicating the presence of significant magnetic anisotropy in the system (Figure SI-22). The M vs. H measured in hysteresis mode from -4 T to +4 T (Figure SI-21) shows the presence of a very narrow hysteresis curve (with a hysteresis width of ~0.1 K). It has been observed in literature that high-spin ferric porphyrins display high zero-field splitting of the $^6A_1$ ground state that results in large value of magnetic anisotropy.$^{52, 53}$

First, the DC magnetic data were analysed with the spin Hamiltonian for $S = 5/2$ comprising the zero-field splitting terms and Zeeman term as

$$\hat{H} = D \left( \hat{S}_z^2 - \hat{S}/3 \right) + E \left( \hat{S}_x^2 - \hat{S}_y^2 \right) + \mu_B g S$$  \hspace{1cm} (Eq.1)

which resulted in $D = 14.1$ cm$^{-1}$, $E/D = 0.0$, $g = 1.81$ (Figure SI-26). Such large axial zero-field splitting parameter $D$ should be the consequence of the orbital angular momentum contributions of low-lying excited states with lower multiplicities. Therefore, also second approach based on M. M. Maltempo et al. work$^{54}$ was applied. This model describes the mixing of two different spin states, sextet $^6A_1$ and quartet $^4A_2$, separated by an energy gap $\Delta = \varepsilon(^4A_2) - \varepsilon(^6A_1)$, through the spin-orbit coupling quantified by the $\xi$ parameter. Generally, the 10x10 matrix must be solved to properly describe these spin-admixed states.$^{55}$

Thus, a homemade model was made suitable to fit magnetic data. In such a way, we obtained $\Delta = 2605$ cm$^{-1}$ and $g = 1.82$ for a fixed value of $\xi = 432$ cm$^{-1}$, which was taken from the respective CASSCF calculations (vide infra) (Figure 8). These parameters imply that the $^6A_1$ state is split into three Kramers doublets with relative energies 0, 39.1, and 119.9 cm$^{-1}$, hence the value of ZFS parameter $D$ can be estimated to be $D \approx +20$ cm$^{-1}$.$^{55}$ The excited quartet Kramers states are located approximately at 3948 and 3987 cm$^{-1}$ (Figure 8).

(full line) with $D = 2605$ cm$^{-1}$ and $g = 1.82$ for a fixed value of $x = 432$ cm$^{-1}$. Right: reconstructed energy levels of respective ligand-field terms and multiplets.

Ac susceptibility measurements were carried out using 3.5 Oe ac field. The temperature-dependent plots of the real part ($\chi'$) and imaginary part ($\chi''$) of magnetic susceptibility show no maxima at zero DC applied field (Figure SI-24). At different applied fields ranging from 0-5000 Oe, (Figure SI-25) there is a dawn of frequency dependence of $\chi''$ observed at temperatures of 1.9 K and frequencies above 100 Hz, but it does not sum up to actual SMM$^{56, 57}$ behavior due to the absence of any clear-cut maxima.

**Theoretical studies.**

The electronic structure and the magnetic properties of I were also investigated by a theoretical approach based on the state average complete active space self-consistent field (SA-CASSCF)$^{58}$ wave function method, which were complemented by N-electron valence second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2)$^{59, 60}$ and also by Hermitian quasi-degenerate NEVPT2 variant (QD-NEVPT2)$^{61}$ All calculations were done with ORCA 5.0 software.$^{62}$ The molecular structures were derived from the experimental X-ray data, and only the atomic positions of hydrogen were normalized with Mercury software.$^{63}$ The ZORA relativistic approximation was used,$^{64}$ together with ZORA-def2-TZVPP for iron atoms, ZORA-def2-TZVP(-f) for lighter atoms, and ZORA-def2-SVP for C and H atoms.$^{65}$ The calculations were sped up using the SARC/J Coulomb fitting basis set$^{66}$ and the RIJCOSX approximation.$^{67}$ The largest integration grid (DEFGrid3) and tightSCF convergence criteria were used in all calculations. First, the results for crystal structure measured
at 100 K are discussed. Usually, the active space in metal complexes is based on their d-orbitals and such calculations are summarized in Figure 9. With the help of ab initio ligand field theory (AILFT)\textsuperscript{68,69} the energies of d-orbitals were calculated, and their energies are ordered as \( d_{xy} < d_{xz}, d_{yz} < d_{z^2} < d_{x^2-y^2} \) as expected for square-pyramidal arrangement (Figure 9a). However, the lowest quartet ligand field term is located at 9396 cm\(^{-1}\) (QD-NEVPT2), which is far away from the \( \Delta \)-value derived from magnetic data. High energy separation of the excited states also caused a small value of the axial ZFS parameter, \( D = 2.1 \text{ cm}^{-1} \).

**Figure 9.** Results of the CASSCF, CASSCF/NEVPT2, and CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 computation for 1 (100 K crystal structure) with CAS(5e,5o). The plot of the d-orbital splitting calculated by ab initio ligand field theory (AILFT) (a), low-lying ligand-field terms (LFT) (b), and ligand-field multiplets (LFM) (c). Note: different multiplicities of LFT are shown in different colors.

This inspired further calculations with large active spaces; first, the \( \sigma \)-type ligand-based orbital was added, forming CAS(7e,6o). Next, the more diffuse 4d metal orbitals were added resulting in CAS(7e,11o). Finally, it was found essential to include also the \( \pi \)-type ligand-based orbital, and thus, the largest active space CAS(9e,12o) was examined. The outcome of the CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 method is depicted in Figure 10 and it is obvious that the dominant changes were induced by incorporating the \( \sigma \)-type and \( \pi \)-type ligand-based orbitals. The active orbitals are depicted in **Figure S1-27**. The energy gap of quartet and sextet...
ligand field terms, $\Delta' = \varepsilon(\Gamma') - \varepsilon(\Gamma)$, was reduced from 9396 cm$^{-1}$ for CAS(5e,5o), through 4679 cm$^{-1}$ for CAS(7e,11o) to a final value of 2749 cm$^{-1}$ for CAS(9e,12o). Therefore, the $D$-parameter also increased from a rather small value of 2.06 cm$^{-1}$ for CAS(5e,5o) to a value of 7.85 cm$^{-1}$ for CAS(9e,12o) (Figure 10). This value is close to those derived from the experimental magnetic data and points out the importance of balancing the active space.

Finally, similar calculations were done for molecular structures derived from X-ray data acquired at higher temperatures to investigate how temperature-induced structural changes (Figure 3) influence the properties. Again, the results are summarized for the CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 method in Figure 11 for the largest active space CAS (9e,12o). Obviously, the $\varepsilon(\Gamma') - \varepsilon(\Gamma)$ energy gap decreases with increasing temperature of the crystal data acquisition, which also reflects an increase of the $D$-parameter from 7.85 cm$^{-1}$ to 10.08 cm$^{-1}$.

Note: different multiplicities of LFT are shown in different colors.

Herein, we also conducted DFT theoretical calculations aimed at comprehending the influence of the spin state on $^{57}$Fe Mossbauer parameters. Therefore, we utilized the most recent calibration protocol published by F. Neese and D. A. Pantazis et al.\textsuperscript{70} and the most recent version of ORCA 6.0.\textsuperscript{71} First, the molecular geometries of 1 were optimized for $S = 5/2$ (HS), $S = 3/2$ (IS), and $S = 1/2$ (LS) spin states using TPSSh functional\textsuperscript{72, 73} together with D3BJ dispersion correction\textsuperscript{74, 75} and x2c-TZVPall relativistic basis\textsuperscript{76, 77} was utilized for all atoms. The resulting XYZ coordinates are available in Supporting Information. Next, the published calibration protocol was then used to calculate the isomer shifts from electron densities resulting from the single-point calculations with TPSS0 functional,\textsuperscript{78} for which we can see the following trend: $\delta^{HS} = 0.416 > \delta^{IS} = 0.333 > \delta^{HS} = 0.296$ mms$^{-1}$ (Table 6). The calculated $\delta^{HS} = 0.416$ mms$^{-1}$ is in very good agreement with experimental data measured at 10 K both for solvated and desolvated samples of 1 ($\delta = 0.42$ mms$^{-1}$, Table 5). Concerning the impact of the spin state on the quadrupole splitting, $\Delta E_Q$ increases with decreasing $S$ as follows: $\Delta E_Q^{HS} = 0.162 < \Delta E_Q^{IS} = 2.128 < \Delta E_Q^{LS} = 2.586$ mms$^{-1}$. The calculated value
of $\Delta E_{Q}^{HS} = 0.162 \text{ mms}^{-1}$ is closest to the experimental data, $\Delta E_{Q}^{HS} = 0.75$ and $0.83 \text{ mms}^{-1}$ for solvated and desolvated samples of 1 measured at 10 K, respectively. The agreement is good, considering that in such DFT calculation, the impact of crystal packing is neglected. To summarize, the theoretical methods helped us to reveal the electronic structure of 1 with high spin sextet ground state and close-lying excited quartet state, which was reflected in its magnetic properties, and $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy parameters.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have synthesized and characterized a five-coordinate Fe(III) porphyrin complex with axial thiocyanate acting as a co-ligand. Structural analyses show that the molecule adopts a square pyramidal geometry, and slight distortions are observed with change in temperature. Paramagnetic NMR solution studies follow the Curie law at the measured temperature range. A first order phase transition is observed at 442 K from DSC measurements indicating some structural phase transition in the system at high temperature. Detailed electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies in the solution state have been carried out which show the different oxidation and reduction processes, and magnetic measurements highlight the presence of a highly anisotropic ground state, which is supported by crystal structure analyses and Mössbauer spectroscopic measurements at different temperatures. These observations have also been confirmed by using CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 and DFT calculations which highlight the effect of temperature on the energy gap between the quartet and sextet energy levels that is responsible for the high anisotropy and structural distortions occurring in the system. We believe our studies will provide a different perspective in the field of molecular magnets using porphyrin molecules as viable options.

Synthesis of FeTMPP(NCS).CH$_3$CN (1)

The reaction of FeTMPPCl (82 mg, 0.1 mmol) with ammonium thiocyanate (19 mg, 0.25 mmol) in 50 mL of CH$_3$CN/EtOH (1:1) resulted in a dark-red solution that was stirred for 4 h. This solution was then
filtered and kept for slow evaporation to obtain analytically pure single crystals of I in 80% yield. Anal.
