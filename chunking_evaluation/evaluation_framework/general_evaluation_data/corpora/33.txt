ABSTRACT

A two-dimensional coordination complex {[Mn(Me-im)₃(H₂O)][Cr(CN)₆]0.5[Mn(EtOH)₂]} (1) (Me-im= 1-Methylimidazole) has been synthesized by following the “building-block” strategy from the reaction between [Cr(CN)₆]³⁻ and Mn(II) with monodentate 1-methylimidazole ligand. The complex was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, magnetic, gas adsorption and spectroscopic studies. Crystal structure analyses reveal that in the 2D network is formed, the central Cr is linked to two Mn centers of different coordination environments in the [CrMn₂] asymmetric unit by Cr₃⁺-CN-Mn₂⁻ bridges. Extension of the 2D network forms “1D ladder like chains” of finite width. N₂ gas adsorption studies on desolvated sample reveals a Type II adsorption isotherm at 77 K. Magnetic studies of 1 reveal strong ferrimagnetic ordering with T_C = 2.15 K. In an attempt to increase the ordering temperature, the magnetic sponge property has also been investigated for this system by successive desolvation and resolvation, and likewise an increase in the ordering temperature has been observed.
INTRODUCTION

In the past decade, molecular magnetism has emerged as an important means to understand the fundamental aspects of magnetic interactions and magneto-structural correlations. Molecular magnets have shown potential application in quantum computing, data storage and molecule-based spintronics devices. In this respect, single molecule magnets (SMMs) and single chain magnets (SCMs) have gained tremendous importance because the slow relaxation of magnetization depends heavily on the magnetic interactions along the chain (for SCMs), high-spin ground state (S\textsubscript{T}) and strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (D). However, the assembly of magnetic building blocks to form higher dimensional molecular systems can also be used to obtain classical magnets where high critical temperatures can be obtained. To generate such “high T\textsubscript{C}” molecular magnetic systems, a suitable “solvatomagnetism” effect is generally observed where loss of the solvent molecules renders improvement in the structural ordering and in extension, the magnetic ordering of such systems. Such molecules, where removal/incorporation of specific coordinated/uncoordinated solvent molecules influences the magnetic behaviour are termed “molecular magnetic sponges” which was first used by Prof. Olivier Kahn in 1999.

One of the ways to rationally synthesize heterometallic systems having the magnetic sponge property is to adopt the “building block” strategy where precursors can be used to control the dimensionality of the final complex. Cyanide-based precursors provide tremendous opportunities here as the cyanide ligand facilitates strong magnetic interactions via bridging metal centres. Likewise, in recent literature, there have been some reports of cyanide bridged magnetic sponge systems using hexacyanometallate and octacyanometallate building blocks which show considerable improvement in the magnetic ordering temperatures, upon desolvation. High-spin hexacyanometallates of the formula [M(CN)\textsubscript{6}]\textsuperscript{3-} (M=Fe, Cr) have been used in the past because of their paramagnetic ground state. For example, in [Cr(CN)\textsubscript{6}]\textsuperscript{3-}, Cr(III) has three unpaired electrons (t\textsubscript{2g}\textsuperscript{3} (O\textsubscript{h})) to function as a cyanide-donor ligand to form heterometallic higher-dimensional molecular systems that show high T\textsubscript{C} molecular magnetism property with long range magnetic ordering. On the other side, Mn(II) (t\textsubscript{2g}\textsuperscript{3} e\textsubscript{g}\textsuperscript{2} (O\textsubscript{h})) in high-spin state having five unpaired electrons enables...
the strong ferromagnetic interactions at high and low temperatures through the Cr\textsuperscript{III}-CN-Mn\textsuperscript{II} bridges.\textsuperscript{16} In this regard, the PBA of CrMn with the molecular formula V\textsuperscript{II}[Cr\textsuperscript{III}(CN)\textsubscript{6}]\textsubscript{0.86}.2.8H\textsubscript{2}O\textsuperscript{7} reported by Verdauger et al shows a remarkable T\textsubscript{C} of 315 K, hence molecular systems based on CrMn are also expected to show T\textsubscript{C} at high temperatures. Herein, we report for the first time, a heterometallic cyanide-bridged two-dimensional [CrMn\textsubscript{2}] coordination network using monodentate ligand, that shows strong ferromagnetic interactions and long-range magnetic ordering at low temperatures.

In this work, using “building block approach” we have synthesized the 2D coordination network, \{[Mn(Me-im)\textsubscript{3}(H\textsubscript{2}O)][Cr(CN)\textsubscript{6}]0.5[Mn(EtOH)\textsubscript{2}]}(1), the desolvated form (1.des) and the resolvated form (1.res) and explored the structural, adsorption, magnetic and spectroscopic properties (Me-im= 1-Methylimidazole).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

**Synthesis and characterization.** The reaction of [NBu\textsubscript{4}]\textsubscript{3}[Cr(CN)\textsubscript{6}] with Mn(ClO\textsubscript{4})\textsubscript{2}.6H\textsubscript{2}O and 1-Methylimidazole in CH\textsubscript{3}CN/EtOH (1:1) resulted in a colourless solution that on slow evaporation yielded colourless long rectangular crystals in good yield (\textasciitilde 32 \%). The purity of 1 was confirmed by elemental analyses and PXRD measurements (Figure S1). The TGA analysis of 1 (Figure S2) shows that it undergoes a 7.4 \% weight loss till 342 K, due to partial loss of bonded solvent molecules (more accurately 1 molecule of bonded ethanol), after which it is stable up to 460 K after which it steadily loses weight till 573 K. The probable reason for the slight deviation in the experimental PXRD pattern is due to the different measurement temperatures (room temperature (298 K) and simulated (120 K)).

Crystal Structures Analyses. Single crystal X-ray structure analyses were carried out on a suitable single crystal of 1 at 120 K (Table 1-3, ESI) where 1 crystallizes in monoclinic space group $P\ 2_1/n$ ($Z=2$). The asymmetric unit (Figure 2) contains a $[\text{CrMn}_{1.5}]$ unit where the $[\text{Cr(CN)}_6]^3$ unit that is bridged to two Mn centres by the cyanide ligand and adopts an octahedral geometry (continuous shape measures (CShM) program $^{17}$, Table 4, ESI) with CrC$_6$ surrounding from four bridging and two terminal cyanide ligands. One of the Mn centres, Mn1 with MnN$_4$O$_2$ coordination surrounding in which Mn1 is coordinated to four nitrogen donor atoms from the bridging cyanide ligands and two oxygen donor atoms from ethanol molecules, adopts an octahedral geometry (Table 4). This Mn centre lies in a special position and is shared simultaneously by the two Cr centres in the molecular unit ($i.e.$, two asymmetric units). The other Mn centre, Mn2 also adopts octahedral geometry (Table 4) with N$_5$O coordination surrounding in which Mn2 is coordinated to three nitrogen donor atoms from 1-methylimidazole, two nitrogen donor atoms from the bridging cyanide ligands and one oxygen donor atom from water molecule. The octahedral distortion...
parameters for Cr1, Mn1 and Mn2 centres have also been calculated using the Octadist program and have been listed in Table 5, ESI.

The [CrMn₁₁.₅] unit when expanded in various directions forms an infinite 1D chain with alternate Cr and Mn atoms (Figure 3, Figure S3). At 120 K, the Cr-C bond distances in 1 lie in the range of 2.050(5)-2.079(5) Å, corresponding to Cr(III) state in octahedral geometry. The average Mn2-N bond distance is 2.244 Å which corresponds to a Mn(II) in HS state. The Mn1-N distance from bridging cyanide is 2.212 Å that indicates that Mn1 is also present in the Mn(II) state. From the bond angles, the C-Cr-C(cis) angles are close to 90° while the C-Cr-C(trans) bond angles are close to 180°. The Cr-C-N angles show a slight deviation from linearity [175.5(5)-178.5(5)°] which is expected from literature values. The distance between two diagonally opposite Cr atoms and Mn atoms is 7.689 Å which is the pore size of the tetragonal void in the 1D network (Figure 3).
Careful analyses of the structure revealed that the infinite 1D chain resembles a ribbon of finite width, i.e., the plane formed on expanding the short contacts is of infinite length only along a-axis, along other axes the network cannot be extended beyond Mn2-Cr1-Mn1-Cr1-Mn2 unit. This finite Mn2-Cr1-Mn1-Cr1-Mn2 unit forming infinite one-dimensional chains along a-axis are somewhat stacked one above the other giving the impression of “1D ladder like chains” (Figure 4). These “ladder like chains” are however, not interconnected, they are weakly held together by CH-π interactions.

Several intermolecular H-bonding interactions were also observed between the terminal cyanide N and solvent molecules (water, ethanol) that are shown in Figure S5.

**Figure 4:** A view of the 1D ladder-like chains formed on extension of short contacts in 1. (Mn: magenta, Cr: cyan, C: black, grey, N: blue, O: red.)
A number of attempts were made to obtain the crystal structure of the desolvated and resolvated phases (1.des and 1.res) but no fruitful results could be obtained due to the poor crystal quality.

**Spectroscopic studies.** UV-Vis/NIR spectroscopy is used to give an insight into the electronic states of the metal centres. The solid-state spectrum of 1 (Figure S5) displays a strong absorption band at 265 nm which is ascribed to the \( \pi-\pi^* \) transition coming from the methylimidazole moiety. A relatively weaker band is present at around 303 nm which can be assigned to the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer band coming from \( \text{Mn}^{\text{II}} \rightarrow \text{Methylimidazole ligand} \). There is another broad band centered at around 369 nm which is due to the electronic transitions coming from the \( \text{Cr}^{\text{III}} \) centre \( (^4\text{T}_{2g} \leftarrow ^4\text{A}_{2g}) \). The UV spectrum of 1.des also follows a similar trend.

It is well known that IR spectroscopy is an important tool to characterize the electronic state and bridging mode of cyanide-bridged metal complexes since the cyanide stretching frequency \( (\nu_{\text{CN}}) \) is quite sensitive to the oxidation state and spin state of the bridged metal centre. IR measurements carried out on 1 (Figure S6) show the characteristic \( \nu_{\text{CN}} \) stretches at 2145 and 2130 cm\(^{-1}\), that is quite shifted from the building block \([\text{NBu}_4]_3[\text{Cr(CN)}_6] \) where the \( \nu_{\text{CN}} \) stretch is seen at 2110 cm\(^{-1}\). These correspond to the bridged cyanide (\( \text{i.e., Cr}^{\text{III}}_{\text{LS}}-\text{CN}-\text{Mn}^{\text{II}}_{\text{HS}} \)) and terminal cyanide stretches, respectively. The IR spectrum also shows the characteristic \( \nu_{\text{C-H}} \) and \( \nu_{\text{C-N}} \) stretches at 3135 and 1625 cm\(^{-1}\) respectively coming from the 1-methylimidazole ligand. In 1.des, the \( \nu_{\text{CN}} \) of \{\text{Cr}^{\text{II}}-\text{CN}-\text{Mn}^{\text{II}}\} \) unit is blue shifted to 2151 cm\(^{-1}\) while the terminal cyanide stretch shifts to 2123 cm\(^{-1}\). Also, the \( \nu_{\text{O-H}} \) stretch at 3300 cm\(^{-1}\) vanishes which indicates the complete removal of ethanol molecules. Again in 1.res, the \( \nu_{\text{CN}} \) of \{\text{Cr}^{\text{II}}-\text{CN}-\text{Mn}^{\text{II}}\} \) unit comes back to 2150 cm\(^{-1}\) and the terminal cyanide shifts to 2133 cm\(^{-1}\).

Variable-temperature IR studies were performed on 1 in the temperature range of 300- 120 K (Figure S7, Figure S8) and 300- 400 K (Figure S9, Figure S10) in both cooling and heating modes. While decreasing the temperature to 120 K, the \( \nu_{\text{CN}} \) (bridging) stretch shows a small shift of 2150-2155 cm\(^{-1}\)
(Figure S8) which is reversible during the heating cycle, while the terminal cyanide stretch remains almost unchanged with change in temperature.

Gas adsorption studies. $N_2$ adsorption studies were performed on the desolvated sample $1$.des at 77 K to understand the nature of porosity of the sample. It was seen that $1$.des follows a Type II adsorption isotherm (Figure S11) indicating that the sample is mesoporous (with a mean pore diameter of 102.76 nm and average surface area of 3.3679 m$^2$g$^{-1}$ (BET Plot)), therefore, mainly surface adsorption takes place.

Magnetic studies. Magnetic measurements were performed on $1$ in the temperature range of 1.9-300 K under an applied DC field of 1000 and 10000 Oe to determine the thermal dependence of the $\chi_T$ ($\chi$ is the magnetic susceptibility equal to $M/H$ per [CrMn$_{1.5}$] unit) as a function of temperature (Figure 5, left). At 300 K, the measured $\chi_T$ value is 5.89 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K, which is lower than the spin-only $\chi_T$ value of 8.437 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K (g= 2.0) that is expected for one [CrMn$_{1.5}$] unit with Cr(III) ion having $t_{2g}^3e_g^0$ electronic configuration with $S=3/2$ and Mn(II) ions having $t_{2g}^3e_g^2$ electronic configuration with $S=5/2$. This suggests dominant antiferromagnetic exchange in $1$, which is also evident from further decrease of the $\chi_T$ value on lowering the temperature down 60 K where $\chi_T$ reaches a value of 4.57 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K. Below this temperature, the $\chi_T$ vs. T plot shows a strong field dependence which is predicted for systems having large magnetic moment, exhibiting rapid saturation of magnetic moment at low temperatures. Upon further cooling, the $\chi_T$ value starts increasing smoothly till it reaches a maximum value of 49.72 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 4.75 K, due to topology of AF exchange within 1D chains. After this, the $\chi_T$ value decreases to reach a final value of 26.29 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 1.9 K indicating saturation of the magnetic moment at low temperatures. The Curie-Weiss fit for the magnetic moments also gives a $\theta_{CW}$ of -26 K which signifies the antiferromagnetic interactions present in the system (Figure 5, right).

Meanwhile, temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility curves of the desolvated phase 1.des in the temperature range of 200 – 1.9 K at 1000 Oe applied DC field show the $\chi T$ value of 5.65 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 200 K which is lower than the spin-only $\chi T$ value of 8.437 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K ($g$= 2.0) that is expected for one [CrMn$_{1.5}$] unit with Cr(III) ion having $t_{2g}^3e_g^0$ electronic configuration with $S$=3/2 and Mn(II) ions having $t_{2g}^3e_g^2$ electronic configuration with $S$=5/2 (Figure 6, right). This indicates the antiferromagnetic interactions of the two neighbouring metal centres. Upon lowering of temperature, the $\chi T$ value decreases gradually to 5.05 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 98 K below which it increases sharply to attain three maxima values of 55.09 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 50 K, 55.90 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 33 K and finally 73.4 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 8.5 K, respectively below which the $\chi T$ value falls rapidly to 21.61 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K at 2 K. This behavior is indicative of ferrimagnetic ordering.

The field-dependent magnetization measurements for 1 from 0 – 5 T at 1.9, 4, 6 and 8 K (Figure S13, left) shows that the magnetization value is 3.65 $\mu$B at 1.9 K and 5 T. The value is much lower than the value expected for 1 Cr$^{III}_{LS}$ ($S = 3/2$) and 1.5 Mn$^{III}_{HS}$ ($S = 5/2$). M vs. H measurements were performed at 100 K to check for the presence of ferromagnetic impurities which were found to be absent (Figure S14, left).

Also, the M vs. H/T curve (Figure S13, right) shows the non-superposition of data at different temperatures on a single master curve, indicating the presence of magnetic anisotropy in the system coming from the paramagnetic [CrMn$_{1.5}$] unit. The M vs. H measured in hysteresis mode from -5 T to +5 T (Figure S14, right) does not show the presence of any remnant magnetization. On the other hand, the magnetization value for the desolvated phase 1.des is 3.5 $\mu$B at 2 K and 7 T. (less than 1 Cr$^{III}_{LS}$ ($S = 3/2$) and 1.5 Mn$^{III}_{HS}$ ($S = 5/2$)) (Figure S15, left), whereas the M vs. H in hysteresis mode does not show the presence of any opening of the curve at 2 K (Figure S15, right) but there is a small opening of the curve at 50 K with hysteresis width of 1851 Oe indicating remnant magnetization and soft behavior (Figure 6, right).
Ac susceptibility measurements of 1 show a clear maximum of the in-phase signal of the magnetic susceptibility (under zero DC field) as a function of temperature with different frequencies at temperature of 2.15 K (Figure 7). This indicates the presence of a ferrimagnetic ordering with $T_C = 2.15$ K. Also, a non-zero out-of-phase ac signal appears below 4 K (under zero DC field) and starts increasing with decrease of temperature reaching a maximum at 2.15 K (Figure 7). The peak maxima remain at this constant value under the application of different frequencies which indicates the absence of glassy behavior or superparamagnetism and shows a perfectly ordered state. Both the in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility signals do not exhibit any field dependence against frequency (Figure S16) which shows the absence of slow relaxation of magnetization for this system. For the desolvated phase 1.des,

**Figure 7:** Temperature dependence of the in-phase (left) and out-of-phase (right) signal of magnetic susceptibility under zero dc field of 1 measured at different frequencies from 1-1500 Hz.

AC magnetic susceptibility curves at 0 Oe DC field show the in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility with maxima at 9 K and 68 K, which does not shift with change of frequency, indicating a pure ordering (Figure 8, Figure S17). Also, for 1.des, AC magnetic susceptibility curves at 1000 Oe DC field show the in-phase and out-of-phase magnetic susceptibility with maxima at 10 K which does not shift with change of frequency, indicating a pure ordering (Figure 8, Figure S17).

Field cooled and zero-field cooled magnetization plots of 1 at 100 Oe (Figure S18) show the maximum $\chi T$ value of 151.77 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K and 156.14 cm$^3$mol$^{-1}$K respectively at 2.89 K and does not bifurcate below this temperature. This also indicates the absence of glassy behavior or superparamagnetism. In case of the desolvated phase 1.des, Field-Cooled (FC) and Zero Field-Cooled Magnetization measurements at 100 Oe show a bifurcation between the FC and ZFC curves below 66 K (blocking temperature $T_B$), indicating a glassy nature of the system (Figure 9).

Theoretical calculations and analysis of magnetic behavior

With the aim to better understand the magnetic behavior of 1, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) was applied with the help of ORCA 5.0 computational package to estimate the isotropic exchange among paramagnetic Mn\textsuperscript{II} and Cr\textsuperscript{III} ions. Herein, the proved hybrid functionals PBE0\textsuperscript{25} was utilized and for selected dinuclear molecular motifs derived from the experimental structure, the high-spin (HS) and the broken-symmetry (BS) spin states were calculated. The energy difference of these two states, $\Delta = \varepsilon_{\text{HS}} - \varepsilon_{\text{BS}}$, helped to evaluate the exchange coupling among several Mn-Cr pairs. The isotropic exchange parameter $J$ was calculated for spin Hamiltonian defined as $H = -J(S_1S_2)$ with the help of Ruiz\textsuperscript{26} and Yamaguchi\textsuperscript{27} formulas

\begin{align}
J_{\text{Ruiz}} &= 2\Delta / \left[ (S_1 + S_2)(S_1 + S_2 + 1) \right] \\
J_{\text{Yam}} &= 2\Delta / \left[ \langle S_1^2 \rangle_{\text{HS}} - \langle S_1^2 \rangle_{\text{BS}} \right]
\end{align}

Such calculations were done for four Mn-Cr dimers with different metal-metal distances as summarized in Table 1. The selected molecular structures with the calculated spin densities are depicted in Figure S19.

Evidently, there is considerable antiferromagnetic exchange between all Mn\textsuperscript{II}-Cr\textsuperscript{III} couples, ranging from -7 to -11 cm\textsuperscript{-1} values when $J_{\text{Ruiz}}$ is considered. As Mn\textsuperscript{II} ion and Cr\textsuperscript{III} ion have $t_{2g}^3e_g^2$ and $t_{2g}^3e_g^0$ electronic configurations, respectively, the metal-based magnetic orbitals based on three $t_{2g}$ orbitals of these ions
facilitate significant orbital overlap through cyanide-bridging ligands resulting in dominant antiferromagnetic coupling$^{28}$.

Next, the attempt was made to utilize this information and model dc magnetic properties of 1 using spin Hamiltonian formalism. First, the model comprising one Mn$_3$Cr$_2$ unit was used as

$$\hat{H} = -J \left( S_1^{\text{Mn}} \cdot S_2^{\text{Cr}} + S_2^{\text{Cr}} \cdot S_3^{\text{Mn}} + S_3^{\text{Mn}} \cdot S_4^{\text{Cr}} + S_4^{\text{Cr}} \cdot S_5^{\text{Mn}} \right) + \mu_0 \sum_i B_i S_i \tag{3}$$

for which temperature dependent $\chi T$ product scaled per [Mn$_{1.5}$Cr] unit was calculated as showed in Figure 10. Even this simplistic model nicely shows that with increasing antiferromagnetic exchange $\chi T$ product (in cm$^3$/Kmol$^{-1}$) at room temperature starts to decline from value 8.3 for $J = -1$ cm$^{-1}$, through value 7.5 for $J = -10$ cm$^{-1}$ to value 6.7 for $J = -20$ cm$^{-1}$ (Figure 10). This nicely explains much lower experimental value of $\chi T$ product of 1 at room temperature. Second feature of the experimental magnetic data, the increase of $\chi T$ product at lower temperatures, is also recovered successfully.

The magnetic data are scaled per [Mn$_{1.5}$Cr] unit.](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-td169 ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5061-2326 Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.

We are aware that model in Eq. 3 is very simple and does not cover properly all magnetic interactions in the 2D sheets of 1, thus more sophisticated spin Hamiltonian was proposed as

\[
\hat{H} = -J \left( S_{1\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{2\text{Cr}} + S_{1\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{7\text{Cr}} + S_{2\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{4\text{Mn}} + S_{2\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{6\text{Mn}} + S_{2\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{8\text{Mn}} + S_{3\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{4\text{Cr}} + S_{3\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{7\text{Cr}} + S_{3\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{9\text{Cr}} + S_{4\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{5\text{Mn}} + S_{4\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{8\text{Mn}} + S_{4\text{Cr}} \cdot S_{10\text{Mn}} + S_{5\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{9\text{Cr}} + S_{6\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{7\text{Cr}} + S_{6\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{8\text{Mn}} + S_{6\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{9\text{Cr}} + S_{6\text{Mn}} \cdot S_{10\text{Mn}} \right) + \mu_B \sum_{i} B_i S_{i} \tag{4}
\]

in which two Mn$_3$Cr$_2$ units was incorporated as showed in Figure 11. However, increasing the number of spin centres from Mn$_3$Cr$_2$ to Mn$_6$Cr$_4$ led to enormous increase of spin states, namely, from $6^34^2 = 3\,456$ to $6^64^4 = 11\,943\,936$ spin states, which is not possible to analyse anymore. Therefore, we modified this model by lowering the spin values, namely spins $5/2$ were replaced by spins $3/2$, and spins $3/2$ were replaced by spins $1/2$, which led to $65\,536$ spin states. Such model is feasible to handle, and it should be able to qualitatively reproduce magnetic behaviour of 1. Thus, the magnetic data were computed for series of $J$-values as depicted in Figure 11. The temperature profile of $\chi T$ product is now more similar to experimental magnetic data, because there is larger increase of $\chi T$ at lower temperatures below 100 K. Thus, it is evident that the interplay of antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in 1D ladder-like system indeed leads to the large increase of $\chi T$ at lowest temperatures.
Figure 11: The scheme of spin Hamiltonian (Eq.4) with $S_A = S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_6 = S_8 = S_{10} = 3/2$ and $S_B = S_2 = S_4 = S_7 = S_9 = 1/2$ employed in calculation of temperature dependence of $\chi T$ product ($B = 0.1$ T) of 1 for various $J$-values and $g = 2.0$. The magnetic data are scaled per $[(S_A)_{1.5} S_B]$ unit.

The last attempt to analyze magnetic behavior is based on the classical Monte-Carlo calculations with an open-source program EspinS. Here, the general Hamiltonian comprising the magnetic exchange within the program is defined as

$$\hat{H} = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \left( \vec{S}_i \cdot \vec{S}_j \right)$$  \hspace{1cm} (5)$$

and the primitive cell was defined by Mn$_9$Cr$_4$ ions as showed in Figure 12. As this structural motif of 1 propagate in one crystal direction, the supercell was set as $1 \times 10 \times 1$. The number of warm-up steps and Monte Carlo sampling steps were set to 500 000, and the magnetic susceptibility was calculated in 2-300 K temperature range with 2 K step. The results are depicted in Figure 12 and the temperature profile of $\chi T$ nicely reproduces the main features of experimental magnetic data of 1 and explains that despite antiferromagnetic exchange, the spin topology produces large magnetic moments of these 1D ladder-like chains.
CONCLUSION

In conclusion, following the “building block” strategy using metallocyanate building block and monodentate ligand, we have successfully synthesized Cr$^{III}$-Mn$^{II}$ two-dimensional network which on extension along b-axis forms a “stair” system. Detailed theoretical analysis revealed that considerable antiferromagnetic exchange among Mn(II) and Cr(III) ions mediated by cyanido ligands leads to large magnetic moments of 1D ladder-like units at lower temperatures due to topology of the exchange coupling. Moreover, these infinite ladder-like structures forms 2D stairs motif due to the hydrogen bonds and most likely these interactions result in strong ferrimagnetic long-range ordering at lowest temperatures. To understand the magnetic sponge property, the desolvated phase has also been synthesized which shows a significant change in the magnetic properties. We are currently analyzing the effect of magnetic sponge property on the ordering temperature.
