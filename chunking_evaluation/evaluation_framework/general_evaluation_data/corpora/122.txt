Abstract
This paper aims to compare the concentration of microplastics in recycled and non-recycled toilet paper when tested in a shredded state under controlled laboratory conditions. The goal is to determine whether recycled toilet paper contains fewer microplastics than non-recycled toilet paper. By investigating the microplastic content in recycled and non-recycled toilet paper, this investigation aims to shed light on an often-overlooked source of microplastic pollution. The results will not only enhance the understanding of the environmental impact of toilet paper products but also guide consumers and manufacturers towards more sustainable practices in reducing microplastics in everyday items.

Introduction

Microplastics have become a topic of critical discussion in biodegradability and human sustainability. Toilet paper is an everyday product widely used across the globe. It is typically made from either virgin wood pulp or recycled paper. Recycled toilet paper is often promoted as an environmentally friendly option due to its use of post-consumer waste. However, the recycling process can introduce contaminants, including microplastics, which may be retained in the final product, making it an unknown source of microplastics in wastewater and in the products we consume. Non-recycled (virgin) toilet paper, on the other hand, is less likely to contain contaminants from the recycling process but still contributes to deforestation and resource depletion and poses the chance of containing microplastics due to its manufacturing process and bleaching process. This paper aims to investigate the question “How does the concentration of microplastics in recycled toilet paper compare to non-recycled toilet paper when tested in a shredded state and in controlled laboratory conditions?” Through the usage of oxidative degradation methods the organic matter in toilet paper can be broken down and isolated from microplastics alongside other unintended organic material, similar to how toilet paper can be decomposed with microplastics being left behind in the environment.

This paper’s hypothesis is that recycled toilet paper contains a higher concentration of microplastics than non-recycled toilet paper when tested in a shredded state; and tested with oxidative degradation using hydrogen peroxide and filtration for microplastics.

Discussion & Broader Implications

From the data, we can observe that for recycled toilet paper, the concentration of microplastics ranges from 35 to 43 particles per 10 grams. The average concentration of microplastics is calculated to be 38.8 particles per 10 grams. For non-recycled toilet paper, microplastic concentrations range from 18 to 23 particles per 10 grams. The average concentration of microplastics is calculated to be 20.5 particles per 10 grams. The data supports the hypothesis that recycled toilet paper contains a higher concentration of microplastics than non-recycled toilet paper. Recycled toilet paper has an average of 38.8 particles per 10 grams, while non-recycled toilet paper has an average of 20.5 particles per 10 grams. This suggests that the recycling process may introduce more microplastics into the final product.

The presence of microplastics in everyday items such as toilet paper raises significant concerns about their potential health implications. Although the research on this topic is still evolving, several key points can be highlighted. In the context of air pollution, when toilet paper is shredded or used, tiny microplastic particles can become airborne. These particles may be inhaled, potentially leading to respiratory issues. Once inhaled, microplastics can settle in the lungs, causing inflammation and possibly leading to chronic respiratory diseases.

In terms of ingestion, if microplastics from toilet paper enter the human body through the digestive tract, they can lead to gastrointestinal inflammation, and there is concern that they could accumulate in the body over time. Ingested microplastics may interfere with nutrient absorption or cause other digestive issues.\textsuperscript{4} Furthermore, once ingested or inhaled, microplastics can accumulate in body tissues. Over time, this bioaccumulation could lead to chronic exposure to the toxic chemicals associated with microplastics, potentially causing long-term health effects.\textsuperscript{5} The presence of foreign particles like microplastics in the body can trigger an immune response.\textsuperscript{6} Persistent exposure may lead to chronic inflammation, which is associated with a range of health problems, including cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune disorders, and even cancer.

Additionally, Microplastics often contain or absorb toxic chemicals, such as phthalates, bisphenols, and heavy metals, which are used in plastic manufacturing or picked up from the environment. These chemicals are known endocrine disruptors and can lead to hormonal imbalances, reproductive issues, and increased cancer risks.\textsuperscript{7}

These Microplastics also contribute to environmental pollution, particularly in water bodies. These microplastics can enter the food chain, leading to broader ecological impacts that could indirectly affect human health through the consumption of contaminated seafood and drinkable water.\textsuperscript{8} The continued use of products containing microplastics, including toilet paper, perpetuates the cycle of pollution. As microplastics accumulate in the environment, they increasingly return to human systems through various exposure pathways.\textsuperscript{9}

The health implications of increased microplastics in everyday products like toilet paper are a growing concern. While more research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects, the evidence suggests that microplastics could pose significant risks to human health, particularly through respiratory, digestive, and immune system impacts. Reducing exposure to microplastics and advocating for more sustainable manufacturing practices is crucial for protecting public health and the environment.

Conclusion

Recycled toilet paper, as revealed in this study, contains higher concentrations of microplastics compared to its non-recycled counterpart. This suggests that the recycling process, while beneficial in reducing waste, may inadvertently introduce contaminants like microplastics, which persist in the environment and contribute to pollution alongside health problems. These microplastics can enter water systems, disrupt ecosystems, and ultimately pose risks to human health through various exposure pathways.

The challenge, therefore, lies in balancing the benefits of recycling with the need to minimize environmental contamination. This study underscores the importance of improving recycling processes to ensure that they do not introduce harmful pollutants into the final products. It also calls for greater transparency in the manufacturing of both recycled and non-recycled toilet paper, encouraging manufacturers to adopt cleaner, more sustainable practices.

For consumers, these findings serve as a reminder to consider the broader environmental impacts of the products they use daily. While recycled products are a step towards sustainability, it's essential to push for innovations that reduce all forms of pollution, including microplastics, to truly achieve a sustainable future.

In conclusion, as we strive for sustainability, it is crucial to address the hidden challenges, such as microplastic contamination, that come with recycled products. By doing so, we can guide both consumers and manufacturers towards practices that not only reduce waste but also safeguard the environment from further harm.
