ABSTRACT

The pursuit of innovative approaches to develop lead compounds that exhibit selectivity, efficacy, and safety as potential candidates for clinical trials poses a significant scientific challenge. Natural products, with their inherent diversity, offer unique pharmacophores, chemotypes, and scaffolds that can be harnessed to create effective drugs targeting various infections and diseases.

This study introduces a straightforward, rudimentary, and environmentally sustainable method to enhance the antimicrobial activity of two less potent antimicrobial agents, fostering consistent and repetitive synergism against drug-resistant clinical bacteria. The aqueous extract of fresh leaves and flowers of *Calotropis procera* was subjected to a reaction with a 1 mg/mL ampicillin solution under heat and acidic conditions. The resultant sample exhibited pronounced synergy and heightened susceptibility against resistant strains of *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Salmonella spp.*, augmenting their zones of inhibition from 0 mm to 16.8 mm and from 5.3 mm to 21.4 mm, respectively.

Utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, the study identified 53 phytochemicals in the extract, with oleic acid (13.04%), 1,1,3,5,7,7,7-nonamethyl-3-(trimethylsiloxy) tetrasiloxane (9.50%), 9-heptadecanone (3.75%), cystamine (3.35%), and tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-ol (3.15%) emerging as the top five most abundant phytochemicals. Notably, 18 out of the 53 phytochemicals were associated with known biological activities. Some underwent molecular transformations, generating new molecules or analogues of existing biologically active compounds under the reaction conditions applied.

The analysis revealed the discovery of compounds such as farnesol, cystamine, cystine, metaraminol, d-phenylephrine, and two distinct substituted amphetamine compounds. Three phytochemicals demonstrated anticancer properties, namely farnesol, 4-amino-1-pentanol, and an imidazole derivative resembling the drug Ribavir.

The study's findings underscore the potential of medicinal plant phytochemicals in synthetic combination reactions, either with themselves or other drugs/agents, to yield a diverse array of compounds exhibiting significant pharmacological activities. These compounds may serve as valuable starting materials, intermediates, or derivatives in pharmaceutical production.

1. INTRODUCTION

The increasing global apprehension regarding the dwindling efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of infections and diseases, largely attributed to bacterial resistance, underscores the imperative for the identification of novel approaches to develop lead compounds characterized by selectivity, efficacy, and safety for subsequent clinical trials [1]. As the pace of discovering new antibiotics falters, researchers confront the formidable challenge of devising innovative strategies to counteract drug resistance in bacteria. A promising avenue in this quest is the exploration of synergistic drug combinations, wherein two or more drugs collaborate to generate a more potent and targeted antimicrobial effect. This involves leveraging different mechanisms of action to concurrently target multiple pathways [2].

Minor alterations in the chemical structure of antimicrobial agents, such as modifications in geometry, stereochemistry, or functional groups, can exert profound impacts on their pharmacological activities [3]. These subtle changes play a pivotal role in influencing the efficacy and specificity of antimicrobial agents, highlighting the intricate relationship between molecular structure and pharmacodynamic behaviour.

The process of drug design, discovery, and development is an intricate and demanding task, necessitating the employment of various synthetic reactions. These encompass structural modifications derived from medicinal plants, semi-synthetic derivatives, prodrug synthesis, and approaches from combinatorial chemistry to enhance antimicrobial activities [4-7]. The utilization of diverse synthetic strategies underscores the multifaceted nature of drug development, with each approach contributing unique insights into optimizing therapeutic outcomes.

Natural products emerge as crucial contributors to drug design and development, offering distinctive pharmacophores, chemotypes, and scaffolds that can be harnessed to formulate effective drugs against a spectrum of infections and diseases [8-10]. The rich reservoir of chemical diversity present in natural products serves as a valuable source for inspiration, providing a wide array of molecular frameworks that can be strategically modified to create novel pharmaceutical agents with enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects.

The chemical diversity and potential therapeutic properties inherent in natural products make them prolific sources of biologically active compounds, forming the foundation for numerous pharmaceuticals. These compounds possess an intrinsic capacity to undergo diverse chemical reactions, giving rise to novel bioactive compounds [11]. The dynamic nature of natural products, coupled with their ability to undergo various chemical transformations, underscores their versatility as a valuable resource in the continuous pursuit of innovative drug development.

Functional groups present in natural products often undergo chemical transformations such as oxidation, reduction, esterification, and alkylation, leading to derivatives with altered biological activities [12]. These modifications, driven by the reactivity of specific functional moieties, contribute to the generation of analogues with improved pharmacological profiles, paving the way for the development of more potent and selective antimicrobial agents.

Furthermore, the semi-synthesis approach involves modifying a natural product through chemical reactions while retaining a portion of its original structure [13]. This strategic approach allows for the preservation of key pharmacophores while introducing targeted modifications, striking a balance between harnessing the inherent therapeutic potential of natural products and enhancing their pharmacological properties through chemical manipulation.

The application of combinatorial chemistry techniques to natural product libraries enables the creation of diverse compound libraries with potential bioactivity [14]. By systematically exploring vast chemical space through combinatorial methods, researchers can efficiently identify novel compounds with desirable antimicrobial properties,
accelerating the drug discovery process and expanding the arsenal of potential therapeutic agents. *Calotropis procera*, commonly known as milkweed, holds historical significance in traditional medicine. Its leaves and flowers have been traditionally administered orally for the treatment of Malaria and intermittent fever, while decoctions have been employed for treating Gonorrhoea [15]. The historical usage of *Calotropis procera* highlights its traditional role in addressing infectious diseases, providing a cultural and historical context to its potential therapeutic applications.

Antibacterial screening of *Calotropis procera* leaf extracts has demonstrated inhibitory effects on *Escherichia coli* and *Staphylococcus aureus* [16]. Furthermore, the plant extract has exhibited effectiveness against various bacteria, including *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Klebsiella pneumonia*, and *Escherichia coli*, suggesting its potential as an antimicrobial agent [17]. These findings underscore the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of *Calotropis procera*, positioning it as a promising candidate for further exploration in the development of novel antimicrobial agents.

Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of different extracts from *Calotropis procera*, such as methanol stem, aqueous stem, chloroform leaf, pet-ether acetone leaf, methanol leaf, and aqueous leaf, has identified a myriad of phytochemicals. These include Methyl palmitate, 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (z,z)- methyl ester, 9-octadecadienoic acid, octadecadienoic acid, Methyl9,12-heptadecadienoate, Tetradecanoic acid, (2,3-Diphenylcyclopropyl) methylphenyl sulfoxide, hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester, n-hexadecanoic acid, dodecanoic acid, linolenic acid, ethyl ester, among others [15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22]. The detailed GC-MS analysis provides a comprehensive insight into the chemical composition of *Calotropis procera*, highlighting the diverse array of phytochemicals present in different plant extracts. These identified compounds serve as potential leads for further investigation, offering valuable information for understanding the plant’s pharmacological properties and guiding future drug development efforts.

In this study, our primary objective is to devise a method that establishes consistent and repetitive synergism between medicinal plant extracts and ineffective antibiotics, aiming to counteract drug resistance in clinical bacteria. We intend to leverage combinatorial chemistry techniques to create a mixture exhibiting enhanced antimicrobial properties. Additionally, we plan to conduct antimicrobial screening to assess the effectiveness of the developed combination and employ GC-MS analysis to gain insights into the transformations occurring within the mixture. This comprehensive approach seeks to address the urgent need for innovative solutions in the battle against bacterial drug resistance, providing a potential avenue for the development of effective and sustainable antimicrobial agents.

In Table 1, the comprehensive analysis of the C. procera extract using various solvents [15-19] reveals the presence of a diverse array of phytochemicals. Noteworthy constituents include Oleic Acid, 1,1,1,3,5,5,7,7,7-Nonamethyl-3-(trimethylsiloxy)tetrasiloxane, 9-Octadecenoic acid (Z)-methyl ester, 1-Docosene, Cycloecicosane, 1-Tridecane, 9-Eicosene, Pentadecane, (E)-, Dibutyl phthalate, Hexadecane, 13-Tetradecen-1-ol acetate, 10-Methyl-E-11-tridec-1-ol acetate, Z-8-Hexadecene, Alanyl-beta.-alanine, TMS derivative, 9-Heptadecane, Hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester, N,N-Dimethyl-dimethylphosphoric amide, dodecamethyl-Cyclohexasiloxane, and 2-methyl-Octadecane. Several compounds maintain their parent names while undergoing changes in substituents and/or functional groups. Additionally, compounds such as 2-methyl-Piperazine, N-Methoxy-1-ribofuranosyl-4-imidazolecarboxylic amide, 1,2,5-Oxadiazol-3-carboxamide, 4,4'-azobis-, 2,2'-dioxide, 8-[N-Aziridylethylamino]-2,6-dimethyloctene-2, and 3,3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl)-Azetidin-2-one are likely derivatives originating from the antibiotic used [24]. Furthermore, the analysis unveils novel phytochemicals such as Cystamine, [S-(R*,R*)]-1,2,3,4-Butanetetrol, Cystine, di-Phenylephrine, Metaraminol, N-methyl-1Benzeneethanamine, 3-Propropyolphethamine.

The remaining compounds undergo transformations in substituents and functional groups, posing challenges in determining their source, whether from the plant extract or antibiotic. Moving on to the antimicrobial screening (Table 2), two bacterial strains, *S. aureus* and *Salmonella* spp, exhibit resistance to both *C. procera* extract at 5 mg/mL and Ampicillin at 1 mg/mL. This resistance is attributed to the inherent resistance of the bacterial isolates and the low concentration of the plant extract used [2]. Conversely, the prepared sample at 100 μg/mL successfully inhibits the growth of *S. aureus* and *Salmonella* spp, with inhibition zones (ZOI) of 16.8 mm and 21.4 mm, respectively. This outcome aligns with previous studies where the addition of sulfuric acid to a mixture of plant extract and antibiotic increased the zone of inhibition against resistant clinical isolates of *Streptococcus* spp. (HVS), *Salmonella typhi* (stool), *E. coli* (urine), *Shigella* spp. (stool), and *S. aureus* (HVS) [1].

Similarly, another study [2] reported increased inhibition zones for resistant *Salmonella* spp. following the addition of sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid to the mixture of plant extract and aspirin. This is consistent with [3], where Guava Aspirin Guava GAG, at 0.1 mg/mL, inhibited the growth of *E. coli* and *Streptococcus* spp, with a zone of inhibition of 5.0 mm. Guava Guava, GG extract reacting with concentrated sulfuric acid at 0.1 mg/mL inhibited the growth of *E. coli*, *S. aureus*, *Salmonella* spp, and *Streptococcus* spp. with inhibition zones of 12.0 mm, 7.0 mm, 9.0 mm, and 10.0 mm, respectively. These findings emphasize the potential synergistic antimicrobial effects achieved through strategic combinations of plant extracts and chemical additives.

| Table 2. Mean zone of inhibition, ZOI (mm) of resistant bacterial strains in response to prepared samples |
|-----------------------------------------------|
| Samples                                      |
| C. Procera Extract 5 mg/mL | Ampicillin 1 mg/mL | Prepared sample 100 μg/mL |
| **Salmonella spp** | 0 mm | 5.30 mm | 21.40 mm |
| **Staphylococcus Aureus** | 0 mm | 0 mm | 16.80 mm |

The observed inhibition of growth in resistant bacteria can be attributed to the presence of newly transformed bioactive compounds within the mixture. These compounds synergistically interact with some of the phytochemicals initially present in the *C. procera* extract, enhancing the overall antimicrobial activities of the mixture. This phenomenon highlights the intricate interplay between the transformed bioactive compounds and the natural phytochemicals, resulting in a heightened inhibitory effect on bacterial growth.

One such compound, Cystamine (functionally related to cysteamine) as illustrated in Figure 3, serves as an inhibitor for EC 2.3.2.13 (protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase) and may additionally provide protection against liver damage [26]. This dual functionality of Cystamine underscores its potential therapeutic significance, not only as an enzyme inhibitor but also as a protective agent against specific organ damage, such as liver injury.

This compound’s multifaceted nature, encompassing antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties, positions it as a promising candidate for further exploration in the realm of medicinal research and drug development.

Oleic acid, represented in Figure 6 and identified as the most abundant phytoconstituent in the sample, serves multiple roles. It acts as an EC 3.1.1.1 (carboxylesterase) inhibitor, an Escherichia coli metabolite, a plant metabolite, a Daphnia galeata metabolite, an antioxidant, and a mouse metabolite [30-31]. Additionally, dl-Phenylephrine (Figure 7) is commonly employed for the temporary relief of symptoms such as stuffy nose, sinuses congestion, and ear discomfort associated with flu, common cold, allergies, or respiratory illnesses like sinusitis and bronchitis [32]. The diverse functions of oleic acid, from inhibiting enzymes to its varied roles across different organisms, and the common application of dl-Phenylephrine in relieving respiratory symptoms, highlight the broad impact of these compounds in both biological and therapeutic contexts.

Hexadecenoic acid, octadecanoic acid, methyl ester, as well as other compounds, such as N-Methoxy-1-ribofuranosyl-4-imidazolecarboxylic amide, 1,2,5-Oxadiazol-3-carboxamide, 4,4′-azobis-, 2,2′-dioxide, and 1,2,5-Oxadiazol-3-carboxamide, 4,4′-azobis-, 2,2′-dioxide, possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial activities [33]. The latter group, being imidazole derivatives, has been reported to exhibit antibacterial, anticancer, antitubercular, antifungal, analgesic, and anti-HIV activities [34]. The collective antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties of these compounds, especially the imidazole derivatives, highlight their potential as therapeutic agents with a broad spectrum of applications.

Aramine (metaraminol), depicted in Figure 8, finds its indication in the prevention and treatment of acute hypotensive states resulting from spinal anesthesia. It is also used as an adjunctive treatment for hypotension caused by hemorrhage, reactions to medications, surgical complications, and shock associated with brain damage due to trauma or tumor [35-36]. The diverse applications of Aramine in treating various hypotensive conditions emphasize its significance as a versatile pharmaceutical agent with potential benefits in a range of medical scenarios.

Another compound, 3,3-dimethyl-4-(1-aminoethyl)- Azetidin-2-one, has exhibited notable antimicrobial activity [37]. This finding underscores the potential of the mentioned compound as an effective antimicrobial agent, suggesting its exploration in further research for developing novel therapeutic interventions against microbial infections.

Cystine, shown in Figure 9, plays a crucial role in proper vitamin B6 utilization. It is beneficial in burns and wound healing, breaks down mucus deposits in conditions like bronchitis and cystic fibrosis, aids in insulin supply to the pancreas, and increases glutathione levels in the liver, lungs, kidneys, and bone marrow [38]. The multifaceted roles of cystine in various physiological processes, from wound healing to mucus breakdown and insulin regulation, highlight its importance in maintaining overall health and well-being.

Methamphetamine, chemically similar to amphetamine and represented here, is utilized in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy, a sleep disorder [39]. The recognition of methamphetamine as a therapeutic agent for ADHD and narcolepsy underscores its pharmacological significance in addressing neurological disorders, emphasizing its role in improving cognitive function and managing sleep-related conditions.

CONCLUSION

This study introduces a straightforward, fundamental, and environmentally friendly approach to enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of two less potent agents through synergism, thereby inhibiting the growth of resistant clinical bacterial isolates. The prepared sample exhibited heightened susceptibility to resistant *S. aureus*, expanding the Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) from 0 mm to 1 mm. Additionally, the ZOI of resistant *Salmonella spp* increased significantly from 5.1 mm to 21.4 mm. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis unveiled the presence of 53 phytochemicals, with the five most abundant being oleic acid (13.04%), 1,1,3,5,5,7,7,7-Nonamethyl-3-
(trimethylsiloxy)tetrasiloxane (9.50%), 9-Heptadecanone (3.75%), Cystamine (3.35%), and Tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-ol (3.15%). Among these, 18 phytochemicals were identified with known biological activities. Some underwent molecular transformations, generating new molecules or analogues of existing biologically active compounds under the reaction conditions used. Three of the identified phytochemicals were reported to possess anticancer properties, namely Farnesol, 4-amino-1-pentanol, and an imidazole derivative resembling the drug Ribavir. The findings of this study underscore the potential of medicinal plant phytochemicals in synthetic combination reactions with themselves, other drugs, or reagents, yielding a diverse range of compounds with robust pharmacological activities. These compounds may serve as valuable starting materials, intermediates, or derivatives in pharmaceutical production processes.

The comprehensive phytochemical analysis of C. procera extract reveals a diverse range of compounds, some of which are novel and others derived from the antibiotic used in the extraction process. The antimicrobial screening results highlight the efficacy of the prepared sample against resistant bacterial strains, underscoring the potential of plant extract-antibiotic combinations as antimicrobial agents. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind these synergistic effects and explore the therapeutic applications of the identified phytochemicals.
