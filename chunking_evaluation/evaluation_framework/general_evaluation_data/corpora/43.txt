Organoids Producing Materials

Abstract
Self-organizing tissues, such as organoids, offer transformative potential beyond healthcare by enabling the sustainable production of advanced materials. Resource scarcity and global warming drive the need for innovative fabrication solutions. This prospective review explores developmental biology as a manufacturing process, where the material (e.g., spider silk) and its production unit are self-organized (e.g., silk glands). Biological systems orchestrate the emergence of hierarchical materials with superior mechanical properties and biodegradability, using abundant and renewable resources. Tissue engineering enables the creation of biological systems that surpass current synthetic designs in complexity.

We highlight application opportunities, focusing on spider silk as a model to demonstrate how organs synthesize and assemble next-generation materials. The concept of growing both a material and its organ production units is exemplified by hair-bearing organoids, self-organized from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Key challenges in expanding organoid research to new model species and scaling-up production are discussed alongside potential solutions. We propose a simplified description of these complex systems to help address key challenges. Furthermore, synthetic and hybrid approaches are explored, considering the ethical, societal, and technological impacts.

Though still in their infancy, material-producing organoids present a promising avenue for sustainable, high-value products, fostering new interdisciplinary collaborations among bioengineers, developmental biologists, and material scientists. This work aims to inspire further exploration into the applications of self-organized biological systems in addressing global challenges.

1. Introduction

As the Earth’s climate continues to shift and affects living conditions, human societies face the challenge of reducing their planetary impacts15-18. Moreover, our high-standards of living heavily rely on limited resources6. Our infrastructures are predominantly made from optimized engineered materials, primarily dependent on fossil sources and unevenly distributed elements7. Both climate change and resource scarcity already contribute to human migrations, loss of life, economic burdens and geopolitical tensions9.

To mitigate these upcoming consequences, efforts have intensified in the past decades19,20. But compromising standards of living raises additional challenges21. Given the large environmental impact of our material production industries, reducing their footprint is particularly significant22. However, improvements in sustainability are often accompanied with trade-offs on material performance, slowing down their implementation23. Biological materials open new avenues to keep producing high-performance and sustainable solutions1 (Fig. 1A). Biological materials, such as wood or spider silk, are often considered more sustainable than most conventional synthetics24. They display high mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, toughness, elasticity, adhesion, etc., while being made from globally available and renewable resources; notably transforming wastes into resources25 (Fig. 1A). Natural materials can even achieve a zero or negative carbon footprint26 and their biodegradability supports a circular economy27. But compromising standards in living raises additional challenges. Their production involves little to no external energy, avoids toxic chemicals, and takes place in water-based conditions28. Nature’s biofabrication processes for creating these materials differ significantly from conventional manufacturing29. Material-producing organs contain specialized cell types with complex molecular machinery that guides material self-assembly from the nano- to the macro-sopic scales30, a process we name self-microfabrication (Fig. 1B). These refined hierarchical microstructures, optimized through evolution31, are responsible for their outstanding properties32,33. To produce them, one can use synthetic biomimicry or recombinant approaches34 but difficulties remain in replicating their full complexity35 (Fig. 1C). While living organs are complex biological systems that are difficult to replicate synthetically; they offer valuable insights for conventional manufacturing methods36,37. Innovations in material engineering have consistently helped to improve everyday objects and infrastructures. However, the trade-off between performance and sustainability reveals limitations in current manufacturing approaches38, specifically in (a) material microstructures, (b) production processes and (c) environmental impact:

- (a1) Engineering complexity: biological systems present high levels of complexity, hierarchical control and automation that are hard to replicate synthetically39,40.
- (a2) Many engineered materials may be highly optimized for specific properties (e.g. stiffness) but are often less versatile41.
- (b1) Conventional microfabrication has high infrastructure costs, illustrated by semiconductor foundries42.
- (b2) Manufacturing tools and microstructures: although current microfabrication technologies can produce complex multi-scale materials, they cannot yet produce microstructures in large materials, at scale43, as nature can44.
- (c1) Raw materials scarcity and energy costs: dependency on rare earth elements45 and fossil-based materials46.
- (c2) Sustainability: optimizing properties in engineered composites often introduces trade-offs on disassembly and recyclability47, while biological materials are biodegradable.
- (c3) Significant environmental and health impacts of conventional industrial facilities48.

In contrast, the versatile and competitive properties of biological materials stem from their (a) refined microstructures, (b) unique manufacturing, and (c) ecological integration\(^2\), all of which could help address these limitations if successfully replicated\(^3\). These hierarchical materials\(^24\) have mechanical properties essential in various industries\(^22\); for example wood tensile strength stems from its self-organized composite microstructure\(^25\). Understanding such materials to mimic them synthetically (Fig. 1D) implies to first characterize their properties, hierarchical structure and self-assembly mechanisms\(^41\). Second, the material-producing organ must also be studied to understand its physiology\(^45\) and development\(^46\).

Biological materials’ intricate micro-architectures (a1) have been optimized through evolution for high mechanical performance and versatility\(^25\). Second, the material-producing organ must also be studied to understand its physiology\(^45\) and development\(^46\).

Biological materials’ intricate micro-architectures (a1) have been optimized through evolution for high mechanical performance and versatility\(^25\). Second, the material-producing organ must also be studied to understand its physiology\(^45\) and development\(^46\). Organoids illustrate this principle and can grow microstructured materials, such as hair follicle organoids\(^5\). These tissues, made of heterogeneous cell types differentiated from stem cells, show physiologically relevant behaviors\(^5\) that can mimic material-producing organs\(^53\). This approach could lead to living machines\(^54\); potentially produced in large numbers by leveraging self-organization\(^55\) (b1). Moreover, they can grow microstructured materials at macroscopic scales, as observed in nature\(^56\) (b2), using abundant raw materials\(^57\) (c1). The final products can be highly complex while biodegradable\(^58\) (c2). Organ production units can themselves be recycled, thus reducing the environmental impact\(^59\) (c3).

While current biofabrication leverages specific aspects of biological processes, such as enzymatic reactions or the cultivation of unicellular organisms\(^60\), it has yet to explore its full potential across all scales and material microstructures\(^61\). Self-microfabrication has the potential to complement current manufacturing technologies and achieve high-tech, low-impact materials. It takes inspiration not only from materials’ production\(^62\) but also from the self-organization of their production units. Collaborative efforts in tissue engineering and material science have driven significant progress, especially in creating 3D hydrogel scaffolds and biomaterials that interface with biological tissues\(^61\). Material innovations have been instrumental in advancing organoid research\(^66\). Conversely, this paper explores how organoids could improve material science\(^65\).

Section 2 shows biological materials applications and highlights how an organ can regulate the self-assembly of materials, using spider silk as a case study. Section 3 introduces the principles of material-producing organoids, current advances and an existing proof of concept. Section 4 discusses key challenges, including organoid growth in non-model organisms and scaling up production. Section 5 presents theoretical aspects of organoid development, including tissue homeostasis strategies, the variety of developmental trajectories, and multiscale representations for modeling purposes. Section 6 proposes future directions to overcome challenges and biological limitations. Finally, Section 7 addresses ethical, societal, and technological implications, concluding with key contributions in Section 8.

2. Application opportunities for biological materials

2.1. Exploring new materials

**Biomimicry of biological materials and potential applications**

Many biological materials have been characterized for their outstanding mechanical properties such as stiffness, elasticity, toughness, hardness or adhesion\(^72\). These properties stem from diverse microstructures observed across species, including fibrous, layered, helical, gradual, tubular, and latticed arrangements\(^72\). To broaden the perspective, Table 1 presents a diversity of biological materials as candidates for self-microfabrication, with their main properties, biological origins and potential applications.

**Preprocessing materials for external self-assembly**

Some materials are formed within cells, notably the hair shaft\(^66\), or in a controlled extracellular space, such as spider silk glands. However, other biological materials form without requiring an organ for their production. Self-assembly can occur upon secretion in external environments, which generally simplifies biomimicry approaches\(^67\), without the need for self-microfabrication. Yet some materials still depend on an organ for internal preprocessing prior to their secretion. For instance, the cuticle of insects is initially soft but hardens rapidly in contact with air\(^68\). This chitin and protein biomolecular composite has a preformed microstructure that hardens into a tough exoskeleton through sclerotization\(^69\). Catecholamines, such as dopamine derivatives, oxidize with air into quinones and crosslink cuticular proteins but the microstructure is performed by the epidermis\(^70\). In other cases, materials rely on environmental conditions such as temperature changes, humidity absorption, or dehydration. Some aquatic species notably rely on their saline aqueous environment for material processing, such as barnacle adhesive\(^71\), sandcastle worm cement\(^72\), coral skeleton\(^73\), and mussel byssus\(^74\).

To illustrate how specialized organs help prepare biological materials for their rapid on demand solidification, we detail the mussel byssus example\(^75\). Byssal fibers cure after release, triggered by the higher pH of saltwater compared to that of the gland\(^74\). This fiber anchors mussels to the shore and withstands the crushing waves with its outstanding toughness and underwater adhesion properties\(^76\). Within the mussel’s foot, plaque gland cells\(^77\) secrete plaque vesicles and metal storage particles (Fe/V) into longitudinal ducts\(^78\). Cilia transport these concentrated droplets to distal depressions, where the material forms reversible metal-containing coordination complexes with catechol groups of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)-containing vesicles\(^79\). After secretion from the foot, the fiber is held at its stem by billions of cilia and detaches upon neurochemical stimulation\(^80\). While synthetic and biotechnological methods aim to mimic this hierarchical material\(^81\), self-microfabrication offers a promising alternative for replicating complex material processing.

### 2.2. How an organ regulates material self-assembly

#### Spider silk production

In this sections, we explore the spider silk gland to illustrate how an organ tightly regulates material self-assembly. Its physiology, as the silkworm's, has been extensively studied, making both excellent candidates for self-microfabrication. Spider silk is a prime example of a sustainable material production. However, an in-depth understanding of how an organ tightly regulates material self-assembly at the tissue scale is multifunctional production units that can be designed to replicate the original silk properties. The process involves the transformation of a liquid phase into a solid fiber, which is highly dependent on the composition of the gland dope and the conditions under which the silk is produced. Spider silk is a highly versatile material with potential applications in various fields, including the production of high-performance textiles, composite materials, and biomedical applications.

#### Biological Systems

The biological systems involved in the regulation of material self-assembly in spider silk glands are complex and multifaceted. They include the glandular epithelium, the lumen, and the extracellular matrix (ECM). The glandular epithelium produces the silk dope, which is secreted into the lumen. The lumen is a highly specialized compartment where the silk dope is transformed into a solid fiber through a combination of cooling, stretching, and drying. The ECM provides structural support and helps to shape the silk fiber.

#### Potential Applications

Spider silk has numerous potential applications, including in the production of high-performance textiles, composite materials, and biomedical applications. Its unique properties, such as high tensile strength, flexibility, and biodegradability, make it an ideal material for various applications. The field of materials science is continuously exploring new ways to utilize spider silk for the development of innovative products and technologies.

converting the silk dope from liquid phase to solid fibers. To do so, it regulates the ChemEnv in the lumen, which guides spidroins’ proper protein folding\(^1\). Pulling the hanging thread at the posterior side, exiting the spigot, initiates the process. Pulling the fiber manually, namely forced silking, also induces spinning. Tensile forces propagate via intermolecular interactions, from the spigot to the ampulla, initiating the flow\(^1\). A ratchet and pump mechanism is hypothesized to restart spinning if the fiber breaks within the gland\(^1\).

The solidification of silk solution into fiber occurs as it flows from the ampulla and through the duct. The tapering funnel and duct induce shear forces\(^1\) and align the molecules\(^1\), improving the resulting material properties\(^1,2\). The funnel’s thick cuticle connects the flexible duct to the more stable ampulla\(^1\), and is hypothesized to prevent the dope from

excessive shearing when the spider moves around\textsuperscript{160}. The thicker cuticle also helps to oppose the induced forces from the flow. The duct regulates Chem\textsubscript{Env}s, establishing gradients of salts, pH and water content along its length\textsuperscript{195}. As it flows through these conditions, the dope self-assembles in a hierarchical material\textsuperscript{186}. To complete the conversion to solid fiber and reduce water losses, terminal tubules on the posterior side pump remaining water\textsuperscript{186} and the spigot’s lips retain the aqueous phase inside\textsuperscript{160}. This example shows how a multi-sectional organ can perform coordinated functions for material production.

**Cellular scale: specialized functions acting in a collective**

At the cellular scale, specialized cell types have been localized\textsuperscript{194} and characterized by single-cell sequencing\textsuperscript{159,186}. The core of silk fibers\textsuperscript{186} is secreted by three columnar epithelial cell types localized in the tail (zone A). The middle and outer layer coatings are secreted by two cell types in zone B and C of the ampulla (Fig. 2C). The columnar epithelia are filled with spidroin vesicles, secreted to the lumen from their apical side\textsuperscript{187}. Each cell type produces a different combination of spidroins, used to define their identity\textsuperscript{159}, and realizes post-translational modifications\textsuperscript{197} impacting their self-assembly\textsuperscript{198}. Another cell type is scarcely present in both the tail and the ampulla, and does not seem to be directly involved spidroin expression\textsuperscript{181}; we therefore hypothesize its role in supporting its surrounding cells or for tissue homeostasis.

The duct consists of a thickening epithelium along its length, as revealed by histology, electron microscopy and single-cell sequencing, which has identified two duct cell types\textsuperscript{194}. A cuticular intima separates the cells from the lumen but enables the diffusion of molecules with its pore-like structure\textsuperscript{199}. The duct cells regulate the lumen’s Chem\textsubscript{Env}, notably the pH with high carbonic anhydrase expression levels\textsuperscript{46}; they are filled with vesicles and have dense apical microvilli\textsuperscript{186}. At the posterior side, flask-shaped cells contain secretory granules and may add an additional coating layer\textsuperscript{184}. Water is continuously pumped out of the lumen during spinning, notably with terminal tubule cells\textsuperscript{186}. The specialized cell functions in spider silk glands exemplify the complexity of material-producing organs, challenging their biomimicry using conventional recombinant approaches.

**Molecular scale: regulation of self-assembly**

At the molecular scale, the spidroins are high molecular weight proteins with repetitive domains, driving their self-assembly in nanometer-scale structures\textsuperscript{200}(Fig. 2D). The silk dope is itself highly complex, made of many components\textsuperscript{159}. Each cell type secretes different composition and quantities of spidroins\textsuperscript{399}, tuning the material properties at each layer\textsuperscript{127}. The silk dope also contains a heterogeneous group of non-spidroin proteins with low molecular weight, named spider-silk constituting elements (SpiCE)\textsuperscript{200}. Peptides, lipids\textsuperscript{202}, glycoproteins\textsuperscript{203}, and more\textsuperscript{204} have also been reported in the silk dope.

The hypothesized functions of the main components are: mechanical properties for spidroins; plasticity and support for SpiCE proteins; water balance, lubrication, and pliancy for glycoprotein coatings; and antibacterial protection and social signaling for outer-layer lipids\textsuperscript{203}. In most MA spidroins, crystalline regions are formed by polyA and polyGA domains, while glycine rich domains give an amorphous phase\textsuperscript{206}. The ratio and size of these domains affects the stiffness and extensibility of the fiber\textsuperscript{207}.

Spidroins are stored in the ampulla at high concentrations, up to 50% w/v\textsuperscript{188}, higher than most artificial spinning\textsuperscript{210}. Spidroins self-assembly\textsuperscript{173} can be described according to three models: micellar\textsuperscript{193}, liquid crystalline\textsuperscript{209}, and liquid–liquid phase separation\textsuperscript{195} (LLPS). Terminus domains (NT and CT) play a major role in this structure: NT dimerizes spidroins and transfers tensile forces, while CT contributes to the rapid, on demand polymerization of spidroins\textsuperscript{46}. Shear forces in the duct and drawdown effects further align spidroin nanoassemblies, stabilized in β-sheets structures\textsuperscript{186}.

Once again, the spider silk gland showcases the intrinsic complexity of biological material composition and processing in vivo. To mimic silk self-assembly with recombinant expression and artificial spinning, the conditions should be greatly simplified. It is unclear if such reduction in complexity will be capable of producing the proper microstructure and versatile properties of biological materials, such as spider silk. Self-microfabrication, using tissue engineering, offers a complementary approach, aiming to grow material-producing organisms\textsuperscript{2}. Insights from spider development\textsuperscript{46,211,212}, at the single-cell resolution\textsuperscript{213,214}, are encouraging contributions toward this goal.

3. Growing organs to produce materials

3.1. Principles of self-microfabrication

**Producing materials at the tissue scale**

We have seen how organs can regulate complex material self-assembly. This section explores how to grow such multicellular tissues, notably from stem cells. Biological systems consist of numerous interacting components organized across scales, including molecules, cells, organs, and entire organisms\textsuperscript{215}. At the macroscopic scale, top-down approaches extract materials directly from organisms, such as tree trunks, cotton, or silkworm cocoons. At the microscopic scale, bottom-up manufacturing produces recombinant proteins (e.g. bio-based polymers\textsuperscript{210}) or guides material production (e.g. concrete biohealing\textsuperscript{215}). Despite ongoing advancements\textsuperscript{218}, biofabrication approaches often depend on monoclonal colonies\textsuperscript{219}. These systems may lack the intracellular and intercellular complexity required by specialized cell types and organs, as exemplified by the spider silk gland example. Bacterial consortia partially address this limitation, notably in biomimetration\textsuperscript{220,221}, but solutions remain to be found for material-producing multicellular organs\textsuperscript{48,222}, which are not covered by current engineering approaches\textsuperscript{22}. This leaves a research gap at intermediate scales, between top-down and bottom-up biofabrication strategies. A rational approach to biofabrication may bridge this gap by directing resources exclusively toward a necessary and sufficient organ, without requiring an entire organism.

For instance, snake venom gland organoids produce toxins for anti-venom research without the need to develop other organs, such as the brain\textsuperscript{223,224}. This approach could also enable new functionalities and benefits; i.e. removing the risk of accidental bites from traditional snake breeding\textsuperscript{225}. To rationalize biofabrication even further, tissues can themselves be edited and improved\textsuperscript{226}, such as multicellular engineered living systems (M-CELS)\textsuperscript{227}.

We propose to define such rational approach as self-microfabrication: the process of fabricating structures at microscopic scale through self-organization. Conventional microfabrication in the semiconductor industry already creates desired patterns\textsuperscript{228}, but barely uses self-organization\textsuperscript{229}. Self-microfabrication also builds microstructures guided by DNA-encoded patterns, and achieves an unprecedented level of control over complex material self-assembly\textsuperscript{230}. This property
differs from passive thermodynamic processes, such as phase transitions in metals, with its common use of energy-dependent molecular chaperones or nanoreactors. Thus, self-microfabrication occurs at multiple scales: self-organizing both production units (organogenesis) and materials (molecular self-assembly). This article explores these principles, exemplified by organoids producing materials (Fig. 3A).

**Regulation by the microenvironment**

Self-organization processes are heavily influenced by surrounding conditions. Cells and organs regulate ChemµEnvs in microscopic compartments, enabling precise spatiotemporal control over material assembly (Fig. 3B). Synthetic approaches mimic these conditions and explore beyond natural processes. Nevertheless, cellular collectives tune ChemµEnvs at microscopic scales and higher complexity than synthetics, and thus achieve hierarchical structures that are difficult to mimic.

The formation of such biological tissues, or organogenesis, is a complex orchestration process. Previous reviews have explored the principles of organoid self-organization. We focus on how environmental conditions influence their development. To introduce a distinction from chemical microenvironments (directing the self-assembly of materials), cellular microenvironments (CellµEnvs) describe the conditions regulating cell self-organization (Fig. 3B). CellµEnvs use various conditions, communication pathways, diffusing biochemistries, extracellular matrix (ECM), mechanical or bioelectric cues, to name a few. Stem cell niches illustrate CellµEnvs, where surrounding signals either maintain stemness or induce cell differentiation. They guide embryonic development, adult homeostasis, regeneration, and more. For instance aged cells can be rejuvenated when placed in a biologically “younger” environment, such as blood or skeletal cells. When the blood circulations of a young and an old mouse are connected through parabiosis, systemic rejuvenation of the older mouse’s tissues is observed. Key factors expressed by certain cells can also reprogram a tissue’s identity, notably the thickening of skin upon volar fibroblast transplants.

In many cases, only a few factors are necessary and sufficient to guide cell behavior and organoid development. For instance, only four Yamanaka factors are sufficient to reprogram differentiated cells into iPSCs. As a second examples, four key signaling factors guide Lgr5-positive stem cells to grow intestinal organoids, not mentioning a few more essential parameters such as the ECM, culture medium and small molecules. Tissue engineering leverages this ability of complex biological systems to arise from relatively simpler external inputs. By leveraging both tissue self-organization and organ-regulated material self-assembly, self-microfabrication aims to create high-value products, such as spider silk-based body armor.

**Figure 3: Self-Microfabrication Overview**

General steps: self-organized living machines may enable the scalable production of high-performance materials for high-value-added applications, such as spider silk for technical fibers and bullet-proof vests.

Key components of self-microfabrication: the cellular microenvironment directs stem cell expansion or differentiation into organoids, while the chemical microenvironment (regulated by the organoid) guides hierarchical material self-assembly.

### 3.2. Material-producing organoids

**Proof of concept: self-organized production units**

Self-microfabrication has yet to be fully established. While many examples exist to demonstrate parts of the approach\cite{1,2,3,4,5}, the hair follicle organoid is the most comprehensive example yet\cite{2}. This organoid self-organizes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to produce a hierarchical material: the multilayered hair shaft. It illustrates how relatively simpler engineered conditions can give rise to a highly complex organ producing material\cite{5} (Fig. 4). The hair complements the spider silk example by demonstrating a material produced within cells, rather than externally.

We describe the hair follicle organoid development in detail to showcase the complex autonomous processes occurring during organogenesis. Hair organoid *in vitro* growth begins with the aggregation of hPSCs, recapitulating normal stages of embryonic development\cite{25} by differentiating into various cell lineages\cite{25}. A spheroid forms and creates an inner cavity\cite{25}. Mesenchymal cells migrate outwards and self-organize in the dermis while the inner surface ectoderm gives rise to the epidermis\cite{2}. Hair placodes appear, develop into hair germs and bulge out in hair pegs to form the dermal papilla (DP) and bulge\cite{25}. Hair-bearing follicles eventually grow out, each containing tissue-specific stem cells that can be maintained *in vitro* for half a year\cite{51}. Within each follicle, a hierarchical material is produced – the hair shaft – implying a complex multicellular regulation of the keratinization process\cite{257}. Hair follicle organoids replicate cell types found *in vivo*\cite{258} and mimic the 3D organization of the real organ, such as DP, melanocytes.

**Figure 4:** Tissue Self-Organization and Hierarchical Material Self-Assembly in Hair-Bearing Organoids

Red annotations represent key signaling pathways involved in the relative cell differentiation between each step. B.

and surrounding connective tissue\textsuperscript{259}. Even the follicles’ patterning is reproduced, with regular intervals between them\textsuperscript{259}. This example demonstrates that complex production units can self-organize from stem cells and assemble microstructured materials.

**Self-maintained production units**

Beyond their development, organoids have integrated mechanisms to self-maintain their function through their lifespan. The hair-bearing organoid homeostasis mechanisms are described to illustrate this unique property of self-microfabrication production units. In\textit{ vivo}, hair follicles contain bulge stem cells that differentiate and eventually replenish the hair matrix cells, which will form the solid hair shaft\textsuperscript{261} (Fig. 4B). This stem cell homeostasis strategy shares common characteristics with other adult tissue homeostasis\textsuperscript{262}. A small pool of cells remains quiescent, maintaining their stemness via microenvironmental signals from their niche, including bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), transforming growth factor beta (TGF\textbeta) and Wnt inhibition\textsuperscript{263}. The anagen phase activates bulge stem cells\textsuperscript{264}, which migrate downward through various Cell\textmu Envs guiding their differentiation\textsuperscript{265}. They become transit amplifying cells for rapid proliferation, and then progenitors before reaching the DP and giving rise to matrix cells\textsuperscript{266}. At the dermal side of the hair follicle bulb, DP cells regulate signaling and nutrient supply, influencing the surrounding Cell\textmu Envs\textsuperscript{267} (Fig. 4C). DP cells interact with matrix cells using diffusing signals through the basement membrane and regulate their differentiation\textsuperscript{268}.

Matrix cells proliferate rapidly and undergo a keratinization process while migrating away from the DP signals\textsuperscript{257,269}. They increase the expression of type I and II keratin proteins, which assemble in heterodimers, then tetramers and finally align head-to-tail in intermediate filaments\textsuperscript{270}. Keratohyalin granules begin to form, increasing keratin’s concentration and storing it within the cells in preparation for their solidification. Inside the granules, filaggrin and trichohyalin proteins help bundle filaments into microfibrils while transglutaminase stabilizes them by cross-linking cysteines into disulfide bonds\textsuperscript{271}, which contributes to the mechanical stiffening and hardening of the hair\textsuperscript{272}. During cell migration, keratinocytes’ nuclei and organelles slowly degrade, halting metabolic activity. The cells are progressively transformed and compacted together in a multilayer solid material composed of microstructured keratin fibers\textsuperscript{273}.

The hair-bearing organoid is currently used as a model in development, wound repair, and hair loss research and creates opportunities beyond medical applications\textsuperscript{259}. A keratinization organoid model offers a promising foundation for studying development, wound repair, and hair loss research and creates avenues for new tissue engineering paradigms. For instance, the self-renewal and proliferation of many stem cells is regulated by their niche\textsuperscript{269}, which can be replicated in\textit{ vitro}\textsuperscript{291}. Characterizing a new tissue’s Cell\textmu Env is challenging due to its complexity and potential differences from established systems\textsuperscript{294}. Defining these dynamic environments involves the understanding of signals from surrounding cells\textsuperscript{295}, diffusing molecules gradients\textsuperscript{296,297}, ECM\textsuperscript{298}, mechanical\textsuperscript{299} and bioelectric cues\textsuperscript{300}. To enable self-microfabrication, addressing the "missing body problem" by maintaining functional tissues \textit{ex vivo} is a crucial initial proof of concept that the organ may eventually produce material autonomously, which has been achieved with spider silk explants.

**4. Challenges in organoid development**

**4.1. Growing new organoids**

**Exploring non-model species**

Most biological materials of interest are typically found in species less studied than model organisms (Table 1). However, growing an organoid relies on preliminary achievements such as cell culture conditions, stem cell identification and a certain understanding of growth factors\textsuperscript{276}. This poses a central challenge to material-producing organoids, introduced here and further addressed with emerging solutions in following sections. Intraspecies variability already illustrates the difficulty of generalizing findings between individuals, notably in personalized medicine\textsuperscript{277}. This issue is further complicated by interspecies variability, notably with greater phylogenic distances\textsuperscript{278}.

Collegial efforts are necessary to unravel new cell identities\textsuperscript{278}, signaling cues\textsuperscript{280}, gene regulatory networks\textsuperscript{281} and differentiation pathways\textsuperscript{282}, to cite a few. The development of the first organoid relied on decades of research on dissociation-reaggregation experiments, embryoid bodies, 3D culture systems and iPSCs\textsuperscript{283}. In comparison, recent developments of organoid protocols in new tissues have accelerated rapidly in the past fifteen years\textsuperscript{273}. For instance, hair follicle organoids have advanced due to progress in tissue regeneration\textsuperscript{284,285}, growth factor discoveries\textsuperscript{286}, niche characterization\textsuperscript{287}, embryonic cell aggregation\textsuperscript{288,289}, stem cell differentiation media\textsuperscript{290}, and patterned hydrogel scaffold development\textsuperscript{291}.

The "missing body problem": cellular microenvironment

When trying to grow a tissue outside its native environment, a basic question is: what is lacking for its survival? In a nutshell, the rest of the body is missing. In practice, only a finite number of cues are sufficient to guide a tissue’s development and maintenance. For instance, the self-renewal and proliferation of many stem cells is regulated by their niche\textsuperscript{269}, which can be replicated in\textit{ vitro}\textsuperscript{291}. Characterizing a new tissue’s Cell\textmu Env is challenging due to its complexity and potential differences from established systems\textsuperscript{294}. Defining these dynamic environments involves the understanding of signals from surrounding cells\textsuperscript{295}, diffusing molecules gradients\textsuperscript{296,297}, ECM\textsuperscript{298}, mechanical\textsuperscript{299} and bioelectric cues\textsuperscript{300}. To enable self-microfabrication, addressing the "missing body problem" by maintaining functional tissues \textit{ex vivo} is a crucial initial proof of concept that the organ may eventually produce material autonomously, which has been achieved with spider silk explants.

**4.2. Scaling for real-world applications**

**Biotechnology costs and scaling-up challenges**

The technology readiness level of self-microfabrication is between 2 and 3\textsuperscript{302} when considering the hair follicle organoids as proof-of-concept. Scaling up organoids for medicine has revealed significant challenges, but potential solutions can be leveraged for material-producing organoids\textsuperscript{302,303} (Table 2). Unlike medicine, self-microfabrication faces fewer regulatory constraints but emphasizes cost-efficiency\textsuperscript{304}. Focusing solely on costs at this stage would be shortsighted, as it overlooks future innovations, automation and economies of scale. Much is to learn from the cultivated meat sector\textsuperscript{305,306} that has even stricter cost requirements\textsuperscript{307}. Biological materials may balance the cost by focusing on high value products\textsuperscript{308} that exhibit high mechanical performance\textsuperscript{31}.

Addressing production rates and biological constraints
Growing biological materials is generally slower than producing their synthetic counterparts. For instance, Nephila spider MA silk is produced 30 times slower than Kevlar, i.e. 5 µm diameter at 10 cm/s for silk312 and 10 µm diameter at 80 cm/s. However, spiders use liquid silk preliminary stored in the ampulla. Accounting for protein synthesis rates would likely reveal an even smaller production rate than synthetic polymers, as observed in other species.334 Although essential, this comparison is somewhat inequitable since industrial polymer synthesis has already gone through decades of optimization. Synthetic biology can also accelerate cell cycle and optimize the growth and metabolism of tissues.335 Indeed, modeling growth rates and gene regulation336 highlight potential improvements337 and trade-offs.338 To compensate growth limitations, material-producing organoids may produce in parallel to increase the throughput. Organ production units are self-organized and compact, potentially enabling their large proliferation in number, facilitating their parallelization.352 Since biological materials aim to improve sustainability compared to fossil-based solutions,337 the environmental impact of biotechnologies should be considered.339 Large scale self-microfabrication may also eventually compete for arable land to produce biomass, as already observed for biofuels.340 Potential solutions include polycultures, yield optimization and circular economies with the valorization of wastes.341 Challenges in developing material-producing organoids are mostly addressed in Section 6. Beforehand, we present a theoretical framework for self-microfabrication to examine key concepts.

5. Theoretical considerations

5.1. How organs are made and maintained

Multiple developmental trajectories
Extensive studies have detailed the formation of organs;343,344 here, we focus on the plasticity of developmental trajectories. Given the challenges in developing material-producing tissues, it is important to note that organoids can often be cultivated using multiple methods, providing alternatives if one approach fails. For instance, intestinal organoids can be derived either from adult stem cells (ASC)345, or from embryonic pluripotent stem cells (PSC) and iPSC346, each using different developmental trajectories. The organoid’s maturity is affected by its cellular origin, but can be partly compensated by long-term cultures and co-culture interactions. Organoids can still be grown in tissues lacking ASCs in vivo, such as the heart or brain,347,348 by leveraging cellular plasticity. Many culture methods have been developed but the field needs standardized protocols and unified representations. For instance, signaling pathways, cell differentiation trajectories and other biological processes can be formalized into workflows with step-by-step descriptions. We suggest that similarly, a systematic definition of organoid developmental trajectories in standardized workflows would help future discoveries. Such workflow description is generally useful for computational approaches and may eventually contribute to developmental trajectory inference, as it is currently the case with signaling pathways.352 Organoid protocols only use a few signaling factors to trigger stem cell self-organization. Developmental workflows should emphasize key induction events, such as differentiation signals, symmetry breaking, or pattern formation. The triggers for these events can be transcription factors, chemical gradients, or bioelectric fields. Specific to material-producing organs, workflows can also describe biomolecule synthesis and assembly.

Tissue maintenance strategy
Once an organ is formed, it is maintained by multiple mechanisms that may be exploited for self-microfabrication. Under normal physiological conditions, also called steady-state homeostasis, tissues use specific maintenance strategies to function throughout the lifetime of an organism (Table 3). Other strategies may be activated following a perturbation, such as regeneration in injuries, dysfunctions, pathologies or aging. This diversity of available tissue maintenance strategies, often within a single organ, can be exploited to grow organoids of interest. For instance, many organoids rely on ASC-mediated tissue renewal,353 such as the hair bulb, basal keratinocytes or intestinal crypts.
### Table 3: Tissue maintenance strategies under physiological and pathological conditions
Some organs combine multiple strategies upon specific signaling, such as steady state homeostasis or regeneration; examples are grouped as follows; green: liver; yellow: pancreas; orange: cartilage; red: blood vessels; blue: zebrafish heart.

Other organs are maintained by progenitor cells with restricted self-renewal, or terminally differentiated cells that revert to proliferation\textsuperscript{405}. Others leverage dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation, such as hepatocytes upon chronic injuries\textsuperscript{406}. Some organs use more than one tissue maintenance strategy, the liver being a prime example. Hepatocytes use cell proliferation during steady-state homeostasis. Following the surgical removal of 30\% of the liver, hepatocytes activate compensatory hypertrophy, and following other injuries like toxin exposure, they can transdifferentiate or recruit progenitor cells\textsuperscript{370}. Switching from one mechanism to the next can be either preprogrammed within cells, or triggered by external signals, such as apoptosis\textsuperscript{405}, phagocytosis, ECM remodeling, and inflammation. Surrounding cells can also signal what tissue maintenance strategy to use, such as macrophages\textsuperscript{408}, adipocytes\textsuperscript{409}, or microbes\textsuperscript{410}. These signals can be induced in culture and engineered to enable tissue growth in non-regenerative organs\textsuperscript{411,412}. Thus, self-microfabrication is conceivable even in non-regenerative organs.

5.2. Dealing with complex organs

A simple representation for hierarchical tissues

We have seen how multiple developmental trajectories and tissue homeostasis strategies enable organoid growth. These mechanisms are complex, interconnected, and operate at multiple biological scales, making them challenging to apprehend. This section examines how to simplify and better understand essential mechanisms of self-microfabrication. Waddington introduced simple representations of complex biological systems, named epigenetic landscapes\textsuperscript{413}. We propose to extend the idea into hierarchical landscapes, describing organ formation across biological scales (Fig. 5A). For instance, at the cellular scale, cell types are viewed as balls rolling down a hilly landscape, where valleys are differentiation trajectories, from stem cells at the top to lower specialized cells at the bottom. These simple diagrams allow researchers to depict and share diverse phenomena, such as cell-cell communication (Fig. 5B). Each layer may be built by integrating experimental data from various sources, such as gene sequences, 3D folding and pathways. Since tissues are made of cells,
themselves composed of biomolecules, we suggest that this formalism may allow a “vertical” flow of information across scales (Fig. 5D). Similarly, “horizontal” information transfer may be envisioned within a layer (Fig. 5E). The purpose is to offer a simple mental image of complex organs and eventually generalize their principles to new material-producing organoids.

As diagrams may be abstract, Figure 6 provides a more detailed representation of hierarchical landscapes. At the tissular scale, valleys represent the multiple developmental routes discussed in the previous section (Fig. 6A). The width of a valley, or canalization, indicates how robust development is to perturbations. For example, the “Picasso frog” can self-correct significant embryonic defects. Each location represents an organ state, composed of multiple cell types structured together and linking this tissular scale to the next.

The cellular scale showcases basins of attraction, where a region canalizes cells to an attractor. ASC are metastable attractors, differentiating in multiple specialized cell types (Fig. 6B). Landscapes are useful to find genes guiding differentiation or reprogramming factors. At the molecular scale, a free-energy landscape models biomolecules conformation and self-assembly, it supports discoveries and enables microstructure engineering (Fig. 6C). This representation should not be seen as static, some hills and valleys can dynamically change, influenced by GRNs and surrounding microenvironments. For instance, cell reprogramming factors may “invert the slope” during dedifferentiation (Fig. 5B). Such hierarchical landscapes offer a simple and generalizable representation of complex self-microfabrication systems.

Figure 6: Hierarchical Epigenetic Landscapes

A. Tissular scale: each location is an organ, valleys are developmental routes, and the slope represents organogenesis. Red: landscape, orange: tissues.

B. Cellular scale: each location is a cell type, or state, valleys are differentiation trajectories, and the slope is cellular commitment. Totipotent stem cells are at the top, while terminally differentiated cells are at the bottom; ASC are in middle metastable attractors. Red: cells, orange: landscape.

C. Molecular scale: multiple landscapes are possible at this scale. In a first model, each location is a biomolecule, valleys represent protein folding and interactions, and the slope is the free energy. In a second model, each location is a DNA sequence; valleys represent phylogenetic relationships, and the slope is evolutionary conservation. Both views are complementary. The branching structure at the bottom represents GRNs influencing the landscapes. Blue: landscape and molecules with different colors for different molecular ancestry.
Modeling complex tissues

Beyond a conceptual tool, an epigenetic landscape enables computational modeling\textsuperscript{415}, using General Systems Theory\textsuperscript{422}. For instance, at the cellular scale a cell type’s unique gene expression profile can be viewed as a point in multidimensional space, with each coordinate corresponding the expression level of each particular gene\textsuperscript{423} (Fig. 5A). It is commonly used in single-cell sequencing, with the gene expression matrix containing all information and dimensionality reduction techniques enabling clustering and other data processing\textsuperscript{424}.

Different biological processes can be modeled depending on how the coordinates, or parameters, are defined. For instance, at the molecular scale, using chromatin modifications as variables for the landscape give insights about epigenetics\textsuperscript{425}. If the topography is built using DNA sequences, it may represent GRNs\textsuperscript{426,427}, protein conformations\textsuperscript{428}, chromosome interactions\textsuperscript{429} or phylogenetic relations\textsuperscript{430}. Similarities between these modalities may help to interconnect landscapes (Fig. 5E).

Lakescapes have been defined at many biological scales\textsuperscript{431}, including the tissue layer describing developmental trajectories during morphogenesis\textsuperscript{435}. We suggest that interconnecting them can allow the flow of information across scales (Fig. 5D). As cells are easier to characterize than organs, tissue landscapes may be inferred from more accessible cell measurements, such as single-cell transcriptomics used in cellular landscapes\textsuperscript{432,433}, even in non-model species\textsuperscript{434}. To support the idea of vertical interconnections, we propose a theoretical demonstration of its feasibility. Consider a space X representing a molecular landscape with biomolecules x, y as the cellular landscape, and Z tissue. P(x) is the probability of a molecule x to be in a particular state, the same applies to P(y) for a cell, and P(z) for a tissue. Using experimental data, the density distributions of P(x), P(y) and P(z) can be computed (e.g. gaussian mixture models, normalization flows, variational autoencoders or other methods\textsuperscript{435}). Similarly, conditional probabilities can be derived from empirical data, such as P(y|z), the probability of a cell type y being in a tissue z, and P(z|y) that a tissue z contains a given cell y. To carry the contribution from one scale to the next, we need to connect them hierarchically (X→Y→Z). As an example, we focus solely on two scales (Y→Z).

Equation 1 expresses P(z), the probability of a tissue state, as a marginal distribution derived from P(y,z), the joint probability of a cell state y and a tissue state z:

\[
P(z) = \int P(y,z) \ dy = \int P(y|z) P(z) \ dy
\]

Using Bayes' theorem (Equation 2), we can further decompose P(z) in terms of P(y), the cell state probability, and P(z|y), the probability that a tissue state contains a specific cell state. This highlights the dependence of tissues on the lower cellular level.

\[
P(z) = \int P(y) P(z|y) \ dy
\]

To create the landscape’s topography (Fig. 5A), we use a potential (V) analogous to energy landscapes used in physics and biology:

\[
V_2(z) = -\ln(P(z)) \ and \ V_2(y) = -\ln(P(y))
\]

Finally, the potential at the tissue scale (V_2) is derived from the cell-scale landscape (V_2) and the conditional probability P(z|y), creating a bridge between these scales:

\[
V_2(z) = -\ln\left(\int e^{-W(y)} P(z|y) \ dy\right)
\]

It is currently challenging to estimate the probability P(z) of a tissue to be in a specific state as it would require extensive measurements from numerous tissues and samples. Instead, we show that interconnected landscapes can potentially derive P(z) using only a few observations of cells within a tissue P(2y), along with the more readily available probability P(y) of a cell being in a specific state. This development illustrates one way to bridge landscapes across biological scales.

While the proposed framework provides a theoretical basis for bridging scales, more applied approaches are available\textsuperscript{436} (e.g. coarse grained\textsuperscript{437}, agent-based\textsuperscript{438}, cell-cell communication models\textsuperscript{439}, or virtual cells\textsuperscript{440}). In silico representations aim to complement experimental evidence and facilitate the understanding, prediction, simulation, and optimization of biological tissues over time\textsuperscript{426}. In the meantime, valuable insights can be gained from the models themselves. For instance, how cellular collectives, or decentralized multi-agent systems, are programmed to reach specific outcomes\textsuperscript{441}. Improved modeling, prediction and simulation approaches could accelerate the development of new organoids.

Guiding development with cellular microenvironments

Since CellµEnvs control tissue behaviors, we can guide development by engineering these microenvironments. This paragraph discusses key aspects: characterization, modeling, understanding the effects of CellµEnvs, and engineering.

Characterization techniques have improved in throughput and sensitivity in the past decade, reaching single-cell resolution with spatial omics\textsuperscript{442}, measurements of key regulators\textsuperscript{443}, functional perturbations using CRISPR\textsuperscript{444}, and mechanical tests\textsuperscript{445}. Moreover, versatile data-driven approaches help uncover cellular communication pathways\textsuperscript{446} and their downstream effects\textsuperscript{447}.

To model spatiotemporal CellµEnvs, biosignaling fields can be developed\textsuperscript{455}, using scalar values (e.g. temperature, diffusing chemicals or electric potentials), vectors (e.g. velocities\textsuperscript{448}), and tensors (e.g. mechanical stresses\textsuperscript{449,450}). As each cells emits and receives signals, their individual contribution can be added or subtracted to the field. For instance, such “sources” and “sinks” can be localized in 3D\textsuperscript{446} and modeled with diffusion-consumption mechanisms\textsuperscript{451} using secreted signaling factors\textsuperscript{452} and expressed membrane receptors from spatial single-cell transcriptomes\textsuperscript{453}. Maps can be established for each signal, representing gradients of diffusing chemicals\textsuperscript{454}. Biosignaling fields may even be simulated over time, notably using Fick’s second law with C as the concentration and D the diffusion coefficient:

\[
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C
\]

Once a biosignaling field description is established, we may investigate its effect on cell behavior. Local microenvironment can be estimated in each location, notably what signals a given cell receive\textsuperscript{455}. From this, the cell reaction can be deduced\textsuperscript{456}, such as gene expression changes, using cell-specific membrane receptors, signaling pathways\textsuperscript{457} and GRN\textsuperscript{458}. In principle, by updating cells’ expression profile, notably newly secreted signals, the cycle may be repeated to simulate the dynamics of multicellular tissues\textsuperscript{459}. Such computational approach can be simplified to accommodate large amount of cells\textsuperscript{460}, notably using graph representations of interconnected cells, instead of 3D coordinates\textsuperscript{461}. Such biosignaling field reconstruction and modeling from spatial omics data face challenges, including anatomical variability\textsuperscript{462}, dependence on sections orientation\textsuperscript{463}, and destructive experiments\textsuperscript{464}. Improved experimental repeatability and data integration already support time series measurements, encouraging future cellular communication models and simulations\textsuperscript{465}. Once signaling factors guiding development are identified, their spatiotemporal implementation may use various techniques\textsuperscript{466}, notably.
physiology and characterize essential CellµEnv factors for explant cultures. Microfabrication challenges, using transplants already be studied, independently from other self-breakthroughs. CellµEnvs in non-model species, which can lead to unexpected results. Developing the “missing body problem”: cellular microenvironment biological materials. Knowledge transfers could help accelerate the current expansion of organoid technologies to non-model species that produce greater insights into reprogramming factors since Takahashi and Yamanaka’s discovery in 2006. Similarly, the achievement of organoid development by Sato et al. in 2009 has reached many new tissues and organisms (Table 4). Expanding organoids to lesser-studied species, notably for material production, is challenging due to the difficulty to transferring biological knowledge from one species to another. Computational approaches help to generalize information across species, such as the inference of gene annotations, sets, pathways, GRN, phenotypes or cell types. Many algorithms often use conserved molecular components (e.g. orthologs) to find similarities between organisms. Similarly, cross-species knowledge transfer can be viewed as “horizontal” connections between the landscapes of different organisms (Fig. 7A). As hierarchical landscapes can also link biological scales (Fig. 5D), we suggest their use to infer cell types and organogenesis mechanisms from known species to non-model organisms (Fig. 7B). Transferring landscape topography across species could guide experiments by highlighting regions of interest, likely to contain cell types or molecular components, such as promoter, growth factors or “missing links” in signaling pathways. Such cross-species knowledge transfers could help accelerate the current expansion of organoid technologies to non-model species that produce biological materials.

The “missing body problem”: cellular microenvironment

When an organ is removed, or grown outside its native body, it requires specific signals to support its survival. Developing material-producing organoids encourages the study of CellµEnvs in non-model species, which can lead to unexpected breakthroughs. Key signals from the “missing body” can already be studied, independently from other self-microfabrication challenges, using transplants and ex vivo explant cultures. Before growing material-producing organs, explants serve as effective in vitro models to examine their physiology and characterize essential CellµEnv factors for survival. To demonstrate this principle, we have developed a spider silk gland explant that spins fibers in vitro. The MA glands are extracted and cultured in a dish, preserving all structures intact, i.e. tail, ampulla, duct, spigot and the 2 µm diameter threads. Pulling the hanging fibers (the spinning trigger) produces new native spider silk. This explant first demonstrates that spider silk gland may produce material autonomously from the rest of the body and serves as in vitro model for this organ. Other material producing tissues could be studied with explants. As an example, developing a byssus-producing mussel foot explant could leverage existing culture media, growth factors, cell lines and in vitro expression protocols.

Other approaches can be considered to circumvent the “missing body problem”. A material may be produced in a different organ with similar characteristics (e.g. ChemµEnv). For instance, growth factors and gene editing tools are available in silkworms but not in spiders. Thus, silkworms glands can be edited to produce a spider silk analogue. Although the silk glands of spiders and silkworms have different phylogenies and embryogenic origins, their convergent evolution demonstrates material-processing similarities, enabling transgenic silkworms to produce exogenous materials. Edited spidroin, combined with a silkworm silk promoter, can be transfected in Bombyx mori’s genome and sustained through generations, aiming to produce spider-silkworm hybrid fibers at industrial scales. We call this approach “environmental transfer”, for producing an exogenous material in an already similar organ.

Rather than adapting a material to match a similar tissue, the opposite could be considered by editing an organ to produce the desired material. We refer to this as “environment morphism”. This principle of changing the CellµEnv to affect a tissue’s physiology is used in transplants, tissue rejuvenation and humanized mice. A tissue can even change its anatomy following the addition of a single cell type, such as thickening skins following vario fibroblast transplantation. Similarly, we suggest that self-microfabrication could eventually affect an organ’s physiology to improve material processing.

6. Future outlook to address challenges

6.1. Growing new organoids

Exploring non-model species

Many biological materials of interest come from less-studied species compared to model organisms (Table 1). The development of new model species is supported by versatile research tools, notably single-cell multi-omics. Adult stem cells are identified across kingdoms and for many species, cells can be dedifferentiated into iPSCs owing to greater insights into reprogramming factors since Takahashi and Yamanaka’s discovery in 2006. Similarly, the achievement of organoid development by Sato et al. in 2009 has reached many new tissues and organisms (Table 4). Expanding organoids to lesser-studied species, notably for material production, is challenging due to the difficulty to transferring biological knowledge from one species to another. Computational approaches help to generalize information across species, such as the inference of gene annotations, sets, pathways, GRN, phenotypes or cell types. Many algorithms often use conserved molecular components (e.g. orthologs) to find similarities between organisms. Similarly, cross-species knowledge transfer can be viewed as “horizontal” connections between the landscapes of different organisms (Fig. 7A). As hierarchical landscapes can also link biological scales (Fig. 5D), we suggest their use to infer cell types and organogenesis mechanisms from known species to non-model organisms (Fig. 7B). Transferring landscape topography across species could guide experiments by highlighting regions of interest, likely to contain cell types or molecular components, such as promoter, growth factors or “missing links” in signaling pathways. Such cross-species knowledge transfers could help accelerate the current expansion of organoid technologies to non-model species that produce biological materials.

This explant first demonstrates that spider silk gland may produce material autonomously from the rest of the body and serves as in vitro model for this organ. Other material producing tissues could be studied with explants. As an example, developing a byssus-producing mussel foot explant could leverage existing culture media, growth factors, cell lines and in vitro expression protocols.

Other approaches can be considered to circumvent the “missing body problem”. A material may be produced in a different organ with similar characteristics (e.g. ChemµEnv). For instance, growth factors and gene editing tools are available in silkworms but not in spiders. Thus, silkworms glands can be edited to produce a spider silk analogue. Although the silk glands of spiders and silkworms have different phylogenies and embryogenic origins, their convergent evolution demonstrates material-processing similarities, enabling transgenic silkworms to produce exogenous materials. Edited spidroin, combined with a silkworm silk promoter, can be transfected in Bombyx mori’s genome and sustained through generations, aiming to produce spider-silkworm hybrid fibers at industrial scales. We call this approach “environmental transfer”, for producing an exogenous material in an already similar organ.

Rather than adapting a material to match a similar tissue, the opposite could be considered by editing an organ to produce the desired material. We refer to this as “environment morphism”. This principle of changing the CellµEnv to affect a tissue’s physiology is used in transplants, tissue rejuvenation and humanized mice. A tissue can even change its anatomy following the addition of a single cell type, such as thickening skins following vario fibroblast transplantation. Similarly, we suggest that self-microfabrication could eventually affect an organ’s physiology to improve material processing.

6.2. Overcoming biological limitations

**Synthetic and hybrid routes**

Although natural selection led to optimal biological systems, synthetic approaches can go beyond\(^{223}\). Biological machinery provides key insights to improve biological materials production, though it also has limitations that can eventually be overcome. For instance, spider silk proteins can be improved with highly hydrophobic domains, but cells are incapable of synthesizing them as their increased hydrophobicity prevents the engineered proteins from passing the endoplasmic reticulum membrane\(^{547}\). Synthetic routes can reach normal inaccessible regions of the molecular epigenetic landscapes and create new optimal materials\(^{548-551}\) (Fig. 8).

Content not peer-reviewed by ChemRxiv.
Biohybrids can capture the best of both worlds, by overcoming biological limitations while being self-organized\textsuperscript{52}. For instance, neurons grown on microelectrodes arrays (MEAs)\textsuperscript{53} can regulate digital systems\textsuperscript{54}, such as a flight simulation\textsuperscript{55}, and help brain-computer interfaces\textsuperscript{56}. Biohybrids can connect tissues digitally\textsuperscript{57} through long distances\textsuperscript{58}, perform cell-based computation\textsuperscript{59}, and develop biosensors\textsuperscript{60}, artificial pancreas\textsuperscript{61} and robots\textsuperscript{62}.

Synthetic biology helps to design materials\textsuperscript{63}, developmental routes\textsuperscript{64}, tissues\textsuperscript{65}, and cell regulation\textsuperscript{66}. Artificial cells\textsuperscript{67} can even perform multicellular communication\textsuperscript{68} and induce cell differentiation\textsuperscript{69}. “Anatomical compilers”\textsuperscript{70} may help design novel tissues\textsuperscript{71} to perform a targeted function\textsuperscript{72} and self-replication\textsuperscript{73}. Self-microfabrication has much to learn from biological self-organization but can go beyond current biological constraints.

**Beyond materials: self-organized devices**

The recyclability of biological materials may also expose them to degradation by other organisms and environmental conditions\textsuperscript{74}, eventually requiring protection layers to meet industrial standards. Interestingly, spiders create a natural coating on their silk\textsuperscript{75}, limiting protease digestion\textsuperscript{76}. Aquatic species even keep their silk dry with hydrophobic motifs\textsuperscript{77}, inspiring self-assembled composite materials. Biological systems not only grow materials but also composite structures and living machinery. This opens new avenues for self-organized devices, such as insulin-producing organoids transplants for pancreatic applications\textsuperscript{78} or high specific surface electrodes for batteries\textsuperscript{79}. Taking inspiration from the electrolytes in electric eels, high density batteries\textsuperscript{80,81} may eventually be self-organized using an organoid approach. Devices could also be grown by synthesizing multiple materials at different locations simultaneously. For instance, existing anatomies may be edited to express exogenous materials in specific tissues using cell-specific promoters\textsuperscript{82,83}. Synthetic biology can also improve the carbon capture in algae\textsuperscript{84} and could be applied to trees\textsuperscript{85} for bioenergy and carbons storage\textsuperscript{86}. These advancements raise ethical questions explored in the next section\textsuperscript{87}.

### 7. Ethical, societal and technological implications

#### 7.1. Societal and technological impact

**Microfabrication revolution**

Material-producing organoids can not only produce better materials, but also improve manufacturing techniques. Bringing fabrication to microscopic scales has enabled pattern-driven material microstructures\textsuperscript{88} and miniaturized devices, revolutionizing everyday lives\textsuperscript{89}. For instance, photolithography has supported the semiconductor industry, telecommunication, modern computing\textsuperscript{90}, and brought microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)\textsuperscript{91}, sensors\textsuperscript{92} and implants\textsuperscript{93}. However, both manufacturing costs\textsuperscript{94} and production volumes\textsuperscript{95} are constrained by available technologies. In contrast, nature achieves complex self-microfabrication in large sizes and at low costs\textsuperscript{96} through self-organization\textsuperscript{21} (Fig. 9).

Enginingering material microstructure in bulk materials can enhance their mechanical properties, as demonstrated in hierarchical materials\textsuperscript{97}. For instance, while chemically similar to chalk\textsuperscript{98}, bivalve shells are up to 100 times tougher (3.3 to 9 MPa m\textsuperscript{1/2} of fracture toughness), thanks to their microstructure\textsuperscript{99}. At the nanoscale, CaCO\textsubscript{3} crystal grains form microscopic tiles\textsuperscript{100}, blocking fracture propagation and enhancing material properties\textsuperscript{101}. Organic bridges measuring 1-5 nm highlight the competitive feature size of self-organized biological materials\textsuperscript{102} compared to photolithography’s limits\textsuperscript{103}. Self-microfabrication has the potential to improve existing achievements, and introduce innovative manufacturing methods\textsuperscript{104}, such as pattern-driven materials self-assembly. Applications of this approach\textsuperscript{105} promise biological materials combining sustainability with high mechanical performance\textsuperscript{106}.

**Self-organized microfabrication**

Polymers have shaped modern products, with copolymers diversifying applications by increasing the complexity of their components\textsuperscript{107}. However, copolymers are typically limited to 2-5 monomers with simple assembly patterns, such as random and alternating blocks, or graft. Biology achieves higher complexity by freely assembling twenty monomers, along with non-canonical amino acids\textsuperscript{108}, post-translational modifications and multimerization\textsuperscript{109}. This combinatorial genetic code generated all proteins and biological materials, of the molecular landscape\textsuperscript{110} (Fig. 5). Biomimicry first explores naturally selected optima, or peaks on a molecular landscape, and applies them to engineer superior materials\textsuperscript{111} using existing biological machinery and synthetic approaches\textsuperscript{112}. Spatiotemporal control over chemical reactions and materials processing conditions is precisely regulated in biological systems, using nanoscale bioreactors, including membrane-less organelles\textsuperscript{113}. More than materials, the biological machinery itself is self-organized from the bottom-up, maintained through homeostasis and self-repaired\textsuperscript{22}. Using existing developmental trajectories, complex production units can emerge from lower scales of organization\textsuperscript{114}. For instance, only a few genes in Drosophila initiate the complex development of a limb, while altering

solely the bioelectric field in flatworms affects their whole body plan^{24}. A single seed encodes the blueprint for complex plant development. Similarly, self-microfabrication seeks to grow intricate systems from minimal inputs^{2}, blending high-tech development with low-tech implementation (high-dev low-tech). By engineering the conditions of emergence^{60,69}, living machines self-organize and produce hierarchical biological materials^{2} differently than conventional machines^{69}.

7.2. Ethical considerations and contrary views

The complexity objection
A key concern of self-microfabrication is its complexity, notably its need for developmental knowledge in non-model species. Some complex problems require equally complex solutions and may justify why material-producing organoids challenge the "Keep It Simple, Stupid" principle. Even with a simple example, Ashby’s law of requisite variety demonstrates that a certain level of complexity is required to regulate a variety of disturbances^{60}. Interest in biological materials stems from their capacity to collectively optimize multiple criteria that simpler synthetic methods struggle to solve^{3}; including recyclability, raw material abundance, high mechanical performance, use of aqueous solvents, non-harmful chemicals and room temperature synthesis^{26}. Organoids could even simplify the manufacturing of complex systems by leveraging emergence and self-organization^{69}, as discussed in the previous section with the high-dev low-tech approach.

Ethical considerations
Most ethical concerns regarding organoids pertain to human medical applications and are not relevant for material production^{610}. Concerns about consciousness do not apply to material-producing organoids lacking a central nervous system, but remain valid for brain-computer hybrids with advanced cognitive functions^{554}. Animal experimentation should follow the 3R rule ("replace", "reduce", "refine") and self-microfabrication could eventually reduce the need for animals in some conventional farming, as intended for cultured meat^{611}.

8. Summary and Conclusion

Summary
We explore the idea of growing biological organs for material production. Resource scarcity and global warming present challenges in balancing sustainability with the demand for high-performance materials. Biological materials bridge this gap with versatile properties, available resources and biodegradability. We describe the spider silk gland to illustrate how organs regulate the self-assembly of hierarchical materials, giving rise to their properties. Similar organ production units can be cultured in vitro and self-organized from pluripotent stem cells, such as hair-bearing organoids. Growing tissues for material production, helps to approach organoid challenges from a new angle, notably the generalization of knowledge acquired from well-studied species to non-model organisms, such as arachnids. We propose a theoretical framework to help transfer information across biological scales and species. Finally, we discuss research opportunities to overcome biological limitations and produce optimal materials, using synthetic biology and biohybrids.

Conclusion
Organoids can expand beyond medicine toward new applications, notably improving material microfabrication. Viewing organoids as living machines, and developmental biology as a manufacturing process, opens new avenues for self-microfabrication of next generation materials, such as spider silk. Self-organized organ production units, which can generate complex biological materials, have the potential to revolutionize the microfabrication industry by enabling the scalable production of large microstructured materials with unique properties. The prospect of achieving lower marginal costs for producing sustainable, high-value-added products creates opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations among material scientists, tissue engineers, and developmental biologists, paving the way for innovative research trajectories and applications.

Definitions

Organoid
A tissue self-organized from cells, notably stem cells, displaying some physiological behavior, often a miniaturized version recapitulating the organ of origin.

Biological material
Material produced by living organisms, such as proteins or polysaccharides, often referencing hierarchically microstructured materials like spider silk.

Self-microfabrication
Self-organized production units regulate the self-assembly of microscale structures from the bottom-up. Material-producing organoids such as the hair-bearing organoid^{2}, are great examples. This self-organized organoid regulates the self-assembly of the hair shaft.

Conventional microfabrication
Top-down manufacturing processes used to create precise microscale structures, typically for semiconductors, electronics, and MEMS. It relies on techniques such as photolithography, etching, or thin-film deposition.

Chemical self-assembly
Molecules spontaneously forming ordered structures under certain conditions (the chemical microenvironment) without explicit guidance.

Chemical microenvironment
The local chemical and physical conditions like pH, salt concentration, temperature, etc.

Biological self-organization
Spontaneous formation of structured patterns and tissues in biological systems, under certain conditions (the cellular microenvironment) without explicit guidance.
Cellular microenvironment
The immediate surroundings of a cell, influencing its behavior, like growth factors, other diffusing biosignals, gradients, ECM composition, surrounding cells, mechanical stresses, bioelectric fields, etc.

Biosignaling fields
Field representation a CellµEnv’s subset (e.g. scalar, vector, matrix or tensor in one or more dimensions).

Homeostasis
Tendency of a system toward a state of equilibrium, notably during the physiological or pathological maintenance of an organ.

Stem cell
A cell that can self-renew and differentiate into other cell types.

Potency
Potency refers to a stem cell’s ability to differentiate into different cell types. The more potent a cell is, the more types of cells it can become.

Quiescence
A dormant, non-dividing state of cells.

Senescence
Permanent cell growth arrest due to aging or damage.

HOX genes
HOX genes are a group of genes that determine the body plan and the identity of structures during embryonic development.

Simplicity
A system with few components.

Complexity
A system with many interconnected parts.

Emergence
Complex patterns arising at a higher order (or scale) from simpler interactions from a lower order.

Missing body problem
When a tissue is dissected from an organism, grown in vitro, the new CellµEnv might not replicate the one of origin, “missing” the surrounding tissue or the rest of the body.

Environment morphism
Editing an existing microenvironment into another.

Developmental routes
Spontaneous sequential steps during organogenesis or any self-organizing biological development. Differentiation of stem cells is an example.

Inductive events
External signaling events that direct cells or tissues toward a specific developmental fate.

Developmental disruption
When a developmental route deviates from its trajectory or fails to reach an expected outcome, like a normal embryogenic development.

Epigenetic landscape
Metaphor introduced by Waddington to describe how gene regulation influence cell differentiation and development. It represents cells as balls rolling downhill, valleys in the landscape guide achievable cell states and represent genetic and environmental factors.

Hierarchical epigenetic landscapes
Th epigenetic landscape metaphor is extended to multiple scales of biology, stacking them up, including molecular, cellular and tissueular scales (Fig. 5-6); they may be referred to as “episystemic landscapes”. At the tissueular level the same concept can represent not cell differentiation trajectories but developmental routes and organogenesis. A location on such “epi-tissueular landscape” represents a particular tissue, typically composed of multiple cell types, connecting the tissueular layer to the cellular layer and so on (Fig. 5D).

High-dev low-tech
Concept combining a high-tech, or cutting-edge, technological research and development, with a simple, low-tech implementation. Low-tech implies simpler technologies requiring minimal tools or techniques. Self-microfabrication requires a complex development (e.g. studying organogenesis) but may eventually offer a simpler implementation by leveraging self-organization (e.g. planting a seed).

Single-cell and multi-omics techniques
Techniques integrating multiple types of molecular data at the single-cell resolution (such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics).

Spatial-omics techniques
Techniques mapping molecular data to their specific locations in tissues or cells, preserving the spatial context.

Spidroins
Spider silk proteins.

Spider silk dope
Precursor solution of spider silk, notably containing spidroins, peptides, lipids, lubricants and glycoproteins.
