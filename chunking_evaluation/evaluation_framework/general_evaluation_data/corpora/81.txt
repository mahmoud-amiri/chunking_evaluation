Abstract: The first green and fast photoinduced step-growth polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) producing high molecular weight poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is reported. Phenacyl bromide was used as a single-component photoinitiating system under a broad wavelength range. The reported photooxidative polymerization technique has several advantages over the conventional oxidation methods (chemical/electrochemical) such as the use of green solvent and ambient conditions (room temperature and air atmosphere), doping of the polymer with bromide ions during the photopolymerization reaction, possibility to perform bulk photopolymerization and tune the irradiation wavelength depending on the phenacyl bromide concentration. Doped PEDOT synthesized under near-UV irradiation was thoroughly investigated using different spectral and chromatographic methods. It has high conductivity (1.6 S/cm), high molecular weight (32.5 kg/mol) and strong white light photoluminescence.

Introduction

Since the discovery of the unprecedented conductivity of doped polyacetylene by Professors Hideri Shirakawa, Alan McDiarmid and Alan Heeger in 19771-4, there have been huge efforts to synthesize lightweight, conductive, flexible, chemically and thermally resistant polymers. Conductive polymers (CPs), especially those having small electronic band gaps, are promising materials for the production of flexible and lightweight optoelectronic devices, which are widely used in many high-tech devices including wearable smartwatches5-8.

In 1988, in an attempt to derivative polythiophene, researchers at Bayer Company synthesized poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) which became a breakthrough in the development of CPs9. Due to its high flexibility, stability, ductility and biocompatibility10-13, PEDOT and its derivatives are now widely used as polymer light emitting diodes (PLEDs)14, organic photovoltaics (OPVs)15, capacitors16, sensors17 and biomaterials18. PEDOTs and many other CPs are conventionally synthesized in large scale by either polycondensation reactions19-23 that require high temperature stirring of the monomer (EDOT) in toxic solvents catalyzed by expensive transition metal catalysts (Ni (0), Pd (0)) under inert atmosphere or by chemical oxidation which is accomplished using excess amount of strong oxidizers like FeCl3, Fe(OTf)3 and Na2S2O824, 25. This is in conflict with the concept of sustainable chemistry27-29. In order to match the requirements of green chemistry and mitigate global warming, new straightforward methods that do not use additional input energy (thermal/electrical) or inert atmosphere and that can be performed in less toxic solvents are needed.
In this context, light-driven chemical reactions are the most favorable techniques due to the milder reaction conditions and lower energy requirements\textsuperscript{30, 31}. Additionally, light-mediated polymerization reactions can establish spatial and temporal control which is crucial for electronic devices\textsuperscript{32, 33}. Although, there have been few works reporting the photooxidative polymerization of EDOT using photoinitiating systems having graphitic carbonitride (g-CN)\textsuperscript{34} or titanium dioxide (TiO\textsubscript{2})\textsuperscript{35}, none of these works reported the synthesis of high molecular weight pristine PEDOT (not hybrid composite) using a single-component photoinitiating system.

Here, we report, the first photoinduced step-growth polymerization of EDOT using 2-bromoacetopheneone (phenacyl bromide (PAB)) as a cheap, single-component photoinitiator under near-UV, visible and daylight. Best to our knowledge, this is also the first study reporting the synthesis of PEDOT using a single-component photoinitiating system. Depending on the concentration of PAB, the irradiation wavelength can be tuned from UV to visible region. Besides the probability of using ethanol (EtOH) as a green reaction solvent, bulk photopolymerization was also successful due to the high solubility of PAB in EDOT. Conductivity measurements were also employed to check the conductivity of the doped and dedoped PEDOTs. Doped PEDOT was thoroughly characterized using different spectral and chromatographic methods including UV-Vis, fluorescence, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Thermal stability and crystallinity of both polymers were also investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and powder X-ray diffractometry (PXRD), respectively. Finally, the redox potential was measured to calculate the electronic band gap of doped PEDOT. Experimental details and the instrumentation can be found in the supporting information.

**Results and Discussions**

Encouraged by our recent success in the synthesis of technologically important conjugated polymers (PMPyr and PMIn)\textsuperscript{36}, we focused our attention to the synthesis of another important polymer, PEDOT, using the same methodology. UV-Vis changes of near-UV irradiated EDOT+PAB mixture in ethanol was checked in different time intervals. (Figure 1).

![Figure 1](image_url). UV-Vis changes of 1 mM EDOT and 1 mM PAB under 355 nm irradiation (solvent: EtOH).
After the observation of a clear absorption increase in the visible region, we decided to conduct the photopolymerization experiments using higher concentration of reactants. When PAB concentration is high (100 mM) it shows significant absorption in the visible region (Figure S1) allowing to switch/tune the irradiation wavelength.

Doped PEDOT was prepared by mixing 105 μL of EDOT (1 mmol) and 200 mg of PAB (1 mmol) in 2 mL of EtOH inside a test tube which was irradiated inside a photoreactor equipped with 12 lamps emitting light nominally at 355 nm (~100mW/cm²) for near-UV experiment. For visible light experiment 100 mg of PAB (0.5 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of EDOT under LEDs emitting at 405 nm (supplementary video 1) and for daylight photopolymerization 100 mM of EDOT was mixed with 100 mM of PAB in ethanol (EtOH) solution (supplementary video 2). All the reactions ‘color turned from light yellow to dark green-light black (Figure S2) in short time (1-7 min) depending on the concentrations of the reactants and the irradiation wavelength. Control experiments performed in dark showed no change in the color of the reaction.

In light of the previous laser-flash photolysis results obtained36-38, the photopolymerization of EDOT should proceed by successive cleavage of the excited triplet state of PAB under near-UV irradiation forming radical cation (polaron) of EDOT monomer which then couple with another radical cation of the monomer by releasing hydrobromic acid (HBr). The newly formed dimer can also couple with another monomer or dimer to form polymeric species in a step-growth manner (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism for the photoinduced step-growth polymerization of EDOT.

All the polymers were washed with acetone and then Soxhlet-extracted twice using EtOH and tetrahydrofuran (THF) respectively. Some of the resulting doped PEDOT was dedoped by pouring into a hydrazine.monohydrate (N₂H₄):methanol mixture (v:v/ 10:1). GPC of doped PEDOT synthesized under near-UV irradiation, showed traces belonging to polymers with average molecular weight (Mₙ) of 32.5 kg/mol and dispersity (D) of 1.35. Table S1 shows all the GPC results for doped PEDOTs produced under different wavelength.
Although doped PEDOT was partially soluble in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF) and THF, the dedoped PEDOT was not soluble in any organic solvent (Figure S3). The solubility of doped PEDOT can be attributed to the highly doped nature of the polymer causing electrostatic and inductive interactions between the ionic species (and above mentioned polar solvents. Four-point electrical conductivity measurement was performed at room temperature using 1 mm thickness pellets of both doped and dedoped PEDOT (Figure S4). While doped PEDOT was highly conductive, (1.6 S/cm), the dedoped PEDOT was non-conductive (3 x 10^{-5} S/cm). The conductivity of doped PEDOT can be attributed to the dopant ions (bromide), thus, non-conductivity of dedoped PEDOT is due to the removal of these dopant ions after the neutralization reaction with hydrazine monohydrate. UV-Vis-NIR (near-infrared) absorption and fluorescence spectra of doped PEDOT can be seen in Figure 2. Due to the highly conjugated nature of the polymer and significant solubility in DMSO (inset photo on left), doped PEDOT has absorption in the NIR region. When excited at 355 nm it showed a strong white light photoluminescence (inset photo on right) even in diluted solution (Figure S5).

Figure 3 shows IR and NMR spectra of EDOT and doped PEDOT, respectively. In IR spectra, apart from the significant change in the fingerprint region, a clear broadening of the aliphatic C-H stretching peaks ~3000 cm^{-1} and disappearance of the aromatic C-H stretching peak ~3200 cm^{-1} indicate the successful polymerization of EDOT. In the comparison of NMR spectra of the monomer (EDOT) and doped PEDOT, the disappearance of the peaks in the aromatic region ~6.5 ppm and broadening of the aliphatic peaks also indicate the success of the photopolymerization reaction.
Thermal stability of both doped and dedoped PEDOTs was probed using TGA under nitrogen atmosphere (Figure S6-S7). Doped PEDOT was thermally less stable than dedoped PEDOT due to the removal of dopant ions (bromine) during the heating process. However, both polymers showed high thermal stability (35% and 44% by weight left after 900° C, respectively). Powder X-Ray diffractogram of both polymers were nearly identical and showed a highly amorphous nature due to the presence of high molecular weight polymers and lack of low molecular weight oligomers which have crystalline structures (Figure 4). The only peak at 24° corresponding to a d-spacing of ~4.9 Å can be attributed to typical π−π stacking which contributes to the conductivity of doped PEDOT.
Finally, the redox potential of doped PEDOT was measured using cyclic voltammetry in order to calculate the band gap (Figure 5). The oxidation and reduction potentials of doped PEDOT were measured as -0.02 V and -1.52 V, respectively. The calculated electronic band gap (Formula S1) was 1.50 eV which is typical for high molecular weight PEDOTs. Considering the UV-VIS-NIR absorption and the strong white light photoluminescence, the obtained doped PEDOT is a promising OPV material.

**Conclusion**

To conclude, high molecular weight PEDOTs were photochemically synthesized using PAB as a single-component photoinitiator. This new method has several advantages; the irradiation wavelength can be switched depending on the PAB concentration, bulk photopolymerization is possible due to the solubility of PAB in EDOT, in high concentrations of PAB the photopolymerization reaction is very fast (supplementary video 2), PEDOT formed has high molecular weight and high conductivity. Moreover, the photopolymerization can be performed under mild reaction conditions (room temperature, air atmosphere, ethanol solvent/bulk). OPV applications of the high molecular weight PEDOT are ongoing.
